  abstract = {Principal component regression (PCR) is a simple, but powerful and ubiquitously utilized method. Its effectiveness is well established when the covariates exhibit low-rank structure. However, its ability to handle settings with noisy, missing, and mixed-valued, that is, discrete and continuous, covariates is not understood and remains an important open challenge. As the main contribution of this work, we establish the robustness of PCR, without any change, in this respect and provide meaningful finite-sample analysis. To do so, we establish that PCR is equivalent to performing linear regression after preprocessing the covariate matrix via hard singular value thresholding (HSVT). As a result, in the context of counterfactual analysis using observational data, we show PCR is equivalent to the recently proposed robust variant of the synthetic control method, known as robust synthetic control (RSC). As an immediate consequence, we obtain finite-sample analysis of the RSC estimator that was previously absent. As an important contribution to the synthetic controls literature, we establish that an (approximate) linear synthetic control exists in the setting of a generalized factor model, or latent variable model; traditionally in the literature, the existence of a synthetic control needs to be assumed to exist as an axiom. We further discuss a surprising implication of the robustness property of PCR with respect to noise, that is, PCR can learn a good predictive model even if the covariates are tactfully transformed to preserve differential privacy. Finally, this work advances the state-of-the-art analysis for HSVT by establishing stronger guarantees with respect to the l2,â -norm rather than the Frobenius norm as is commonly done in the matrix estimation literature, which may be of interest in its own right.},

  abstract = {Modern randomised controlled trials typically use composite endpoints. This is only valid if each endpoint is equally important to patients but few trials document patient preference and seek the relative importance of components of combined endpoints. If patients weigh endpoints differentially, our interpretation of trial data needs to be refined. We derive a quantitative, structured tool to determine the relative importance of each endpoint to patients. We then apply this tool to data comparing angioplasty with drug-eluting stents to bypass surgery. The survey was administered to patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation. A meta-analysis comparing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to percutaneous coronary interventuin (PCI) was then performed using (a) standard MACE and (b) patient-centred MACE. Patients considered stroke worse than death (stroke 102.3 Â± 19.6\%, p {$<$} 0.01), and MI and repeat revascularisation less severe than death (61.9 Â± 26.8\% and 41.9 Â± 25.4\% respectively p {$<$} 0.01 for both). 7 RCTs (5251 patients) were eligible. Meta-analysis demonstrated that standard MACE occurs more frequently with PCI than surgery (OR 1.44; 95\% CI 1.10 to 1.87; p = 0.007). Re-analysis using patient-centred MACE found no significant difference between PCI and CABG (OR 1.22, 95\% CI 0.97 to 1.53; p = 0.10). Patients do not consider the constituent endpoints of MACE equal. We derive a novel patient-centred metric that recognises and quantifies the differences attributed to each endpoint. When patient preference data are applied to contemporary trial results, there is no significant difference between PCI and CABG. Responses from individual patients in clinic could be used to give individual patients a recommendation that is truly personalised. Copyright  2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on heart failure (HF) incidence among low-income and minority populations. Our objective was to investigate HF incidence and post-HF survival by race and sex among low-income adults in the southeastern United States. METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants were 27\,078 white and black men and women enrolled during 2002 to 2009 in the SCCS (Southern Community Cohort Study) who had no history of HF and were receiving Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Incident HF diagnoses through December 31, 2010 were ascertained using International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision codes 428.x via linkage with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services research files. Most participants were black (68.8\%), women (62.6\%), and earned {$<\$$}15\,000/y (69.7\%); mean age was 55.5 (10.4) years. Risk factors for HF were common: hypertension (62.5\%), diabetes mellitus (26.5\%), myocardial infarction (8.6\%), and obesity (44.8\%). Over a median follow-up of 5.2 years, 4341 participants were diagnosed with HF. The age-standardized incidence rates were 34.8, 37.3, 34.9, and 35.6 /1000 person-years in white women, white men, black men, and black women, respectively, remarkably higher than previously reported. Among HF cases, 952 deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 2.3 years. Men had lower survival; hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were 1.63 (1.27-2.08), 1.38 (1.11-1.72), and 0.90 (0.73-1.12) for white men, black men, and black women compared with white women. CONCLUSIONS: In this low-income population, HF incidence was higher for all race-sex groups than previously reported in other cohorts. The SCCS is a unique resource to investigate determinants of HF risk in a segment of the population underrepresented in other existing cohorts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic environment predicts heart failure (HF) hospital readmissions. We investigated whether neighborhood deprivation predicts risk of incident HF beyond individual socioeconomic status in a low-income population. METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants were 27 078 whites and blacks recruited during 2002 to 2009 in the SCCS (Southern Community Cohort Study), who had no history of HF and were using Centers for Medicare or Medicaid Services. Incident HF diagnoses through December 31, 2010, were ascertained using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes 428.x via linkage with Centers for Medicare or Medicaid Services research files. Participant residential information was geocoded and census tract determined by a spatial join to the US Census Bureau TIGER/Line Shapefiles. The neighborhood deprivation index was constructed using principal components analysis based on census tract-level socioeconomic variables. Cox models with Huber-White cluster sandwich estimator of variance were used to investigate the association between neighborhood deprivation index and HF risk. The study sample was predominantly middle aged (mean, 55.5 years), black (69\%), female (63\%), low income (70\% earned {$<\$$}15 000/y), and {$>$}50\% of participants lived in the most deprived neighborhoods (third neighborhood deprivation index tertile). Over median follow-up of 5.2 years, 4300 participants were diagnosed with HF. After adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors, a 1 interquartile increase in neighborhood deprivation index was associated with a 12\% increase in risk of HF (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95\% confidence interval, 1.07-1.18), and 4.8\% of the variance in HF risk (intraclass correlation coefficient, 4.8; 95\% confidence interval, 3.6-6.4) was explained by neighborhood deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: In this low-income population, scant neighborhood resources compound the risk of HF above and beyond individual socioeconomic status and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Improvements in community resources may be a significant axis for curbing the burden of HF.},

Patients underwent prerandomization research FFR and iFR assessment. The operator was blinded to these values. Assessment of response variables, treadmill exercise time, stress echocardiography score, symptom frequency, and angina severity were performed at prerandomization and blinded follow-up. Effects were calculated by analysis of covariance. The ability of FFR and iFR to predict placebo-controlled changes in response variables was tested by using regression modeling. RESULTS: Invasive physiology data were available in 196 patients (103 PCI and 93 placebo). At prerandomization, the majority had Canadian Cardiovascular Society class II or III symptoms (150/196, 76.5\%). Mean FFR and iFR were 0.69Â±0.16 and 0.76Â±0.22, respectively; 97\% had â¥1 positive ischemia tests. The estimated effect of PCI on between-arm prerandomization-adjusted total exercise time was 20.7 s (95\% confidence interval [CI], -4.0 to 45.5; P=0.100) with no interaction of FFR ( Pinteraction=0.318) or iFR ( Pinteraction=0.523). PCI improved stress echocardiography score more than placebo (1.07 segment units; 95\% CI, 0.70-1.44; P{$<$}0.00001). The placebo-controlled effect of PCI on stress echocardiography score increased progressively with decreasing FFR ( Pinteraction{$<$}0.00001) and decreasing iFR ( Pinteraction{$<$}0.00001). PCI did not improve angina frequency score significantly more than placebo (odds ratio, 1.64; 95\% CI, 0.96-2.80; P=0.072) with no detectable evidence of interaction with FFR ( Pinteraction=0.849) or iFR ( Pinteraction=0.783). However, PCI resulted in more patient-reported freedom from angina than placebo (49.5\% versus 31.5\%; odds ratio, 2.47; 95\% CI, 1.30-4.72; P=0.006) but neither FFR ( Pinteraction=0.693) nor iFR ( Pinteraction=0.761) modified this effect. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stable angina and severe single-vessel disease, the blinded effect of PCI was more clearly seen by stress echocardiography score and freedom from angina than change in treadmill exercise time. Moreover, the lower the FFR or iFR, the greater the magnitude of stress echocardiographic improvement caused by PCI. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dobutamine stress echocardiography is widely used to test for ischemia in patients with stable coronary artery disease. In this analysis, we studied the ability of the prerandomization stress echocardiography score to predict the placebo-controlled efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within the ORBITA trial (Objective Randomised Blinded Investigation With Optimal Medical Therapy of Angioplasty in Stable Angina). METHODS: One hundred eighty-three patients underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography before randomization. The stress echocardiography score is broadly the number of segments abnormal at peak stress, with akinetic segments counting double and dyskinetic segments counting triple. The ability of prerandomization stress echocardiography to predict the placebo-controlled effect of PCI on response variables was tested by using regression modeling. RESULTS: At prerandomization, the stress echocardiography score was 1.56Â±1.77 in the PCI arm (n=98) and 1.61Â±1.73 in the placebo arm (n=85). There was a detectable interaction between prerandomization stress echocardiography score and the effect of PCI on angina frequency score with a larger placebo-controlled effect in patients with the highest stress echocardiography score (Pinteraction=0.031). With our sample size, we were unable to detect an interaction between stress echocardiography score and any other patient-reported response variables: freedom from angina (Pinteraction=0.116), physical limitation (Pinteraction=0.461), quality of life (Pinteraction=0.689), EuroQOL 5 quality-of-life score (Pinteraction=0.789), or between stress echocardiography score and physician-assessed Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class (Pinteraction=0.693), and treadmill exercise time (Pinteraction=0.426). CONCLUSIONS: The degree of ischemia assessed by dobutamine stress echocardiography predicts the placebo-controlled efficacy of PCI on patient-reported angina frequency. The greater the downstream stress echocardiography abnormality caused by a stenosis, the greater the reduction in symptoms from PCI. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

  abstract = {In investigations of the effect of treatment on outcome, the propensity score is a tool to eliminate imbalance in the distribution of confounding variables between treatment groups. Recent work has suggested that Super Learner, an ensemble method, outperforms logistic regression in nonlinear settings; however, experience with real-data analyses tends to show overfitting of the propensity score model using this approach. We investigated a wide range of simulated settings of varying complexities including simulations based on real data to compare the performances of logistic regression, generalized boosted models, and Super Learner in providing balance and for estimating the average treatment effect via propensity score regression, propensity score matching, and inverse probability of treatment weighting. We found that Super Learner and logistic regression are comparable in terms of covariate balance, bias, and mean squared error (MSE); however, Super Learner is computationally very expensive thus leaving no clear advantage to the more complex approach. Propensity scores estimated by generalized boosted models were inferior to the other two estimation approaches. We also found that propensity score regression adjustment was superior to either matching or inverse weighting when the form of the dependence on the treatment on the outcome is correctly specified.},

A finite Markov chain is proposed as a model for analyzing sequences of ordinal data from a relapsing-remitting disease. The proposed model is one in which the state space is expanded to include information about the relapsing-remitting status as well as the ordinal severity score, and a reparameterization is suggested that reduces the number of parameters needed to be estimated. The Markov model allows for a wide range of relapsing-remitting behavior, provides an understanding of the stochastic nature of the disease process, and allows for efficient estimation of important characteristics of the disease course (such as mean first passage times, occupation times, and steady-state probabilities). These methods are applied to data from a study of the effect of a treatment (transforming growth factor-Î²1) on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.},

  abstract = {Statistical analyses are a crucial component of the biomedical research process and are necessary to draw inferences from biomedical research data. The application of sound statistical methodology is a prerequisite for publication in the American Heart Association (AHA) journal portfolio. The objective of this document is to summarize key aspects of statistical reporting that might be most relevant to the authors, reviewers, and readership of AHA journals. The AHA Scientific Publication Committee convened a task force to inventory existing statistical standards for publication in biomedical journals and to identify approaches suitable for the AHA journal portfolio. The experts on the task force were selected by the AHA Scientific Publication Committee, who identified 12 key topics that serve as the section headers for this document. For each topic, the members of the writing group identified relevant references and evaluated them as a resource to make the standards summarized herein. Each section was independently reviewed by an expert reviewer who was not part of the task force. Expert reviewers were also permitted to comment on other sections if they chose. Differences of opinion were adjudicated by consensus. The standards presented in this report are intended to serve as a guide for high-quality reporting of statistical analyses methods and results.},

  abstract = {In the context of cancer diagnosis and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.},

  abstract = {Prognostic models are designed to predict a clinical outcome in individuals or groups of individuals with a particular disease or condition. To avoid bias many researchers advocate the use of full models developed by prespecifying predictors. Variable selection is not employed and the resulting models may be large and complicated. In practice more parsimonious models that retain most of the prognostic information may be preferred. We investigate the effect on various performance measures, including mean square error and prognostic classification, of three methods for estimating full models (including penalized estimation and Tibshirani's lasso) and consider two methods (backwards elimination and a new proposal called stepdown) for simplifying full models. Simulation studies based on two medical data sets suggest that simplified models can be found that perform nearly as well as, or sometimes even better than, full models. Optimizing the Akaike information criterion appears to be appropriate for choosing the degree of simplification.},

Discussions of basic concepts like time axis, event definition and censoring are given. Hazard models are introduced, with special emphasis on the Cox proportional hazards regression model. We provide check lists that may be useful both when fitting the model and assessing its goodness of fit and when interpreting the results. Special attention is paid to how to avoid problems with immortal time bias by introducing time-dependent covariates. We discuss prediction based on hazard models and difficulties when attempting to draw proper causal conclusions from such models. Finally, we present a series of examples where the methods and check lists are exemplified. Computational details and implementation using the freely available R software are documented in Supplementary Material. The paper was prepared as part of the STRATOS initiative.},

  abstract = {The literature on causal effect estimation tends to focus on the population mean estimand, which is less informative as medical treatments are becoming more personalized and there is increasing awareness that subpopulations of individuals may experience a group-specific effect that differs from the population average. In fact, it is possible that there is underlying systematic effect heterogeneity that is obscured by focusing on the population mean estimand. In this context, understanding which covariates contribute to this treatment effect heterogeneity (TEH) and how these covariates determine the differential treatment effect (TE) is an important consideration. Towards such an understanding, this paper briefly reviews three approaches used in making causal inferences and conducts a simulation study to compare these approaches according to their performance in an exploratory evaluation of TEH when the heterogeneous subgroups are not known a priori. Performance metrics include the detection of any heterogeneity, the identification and characterization of heterogeneous subgroups, and unconfounded estimation of the TE within subgroups. The methods are then deployed in a comparative effectiveness evaluation of drug-eluting versus bare-metal stents among 54 099 Medicare beneficiaries in the continental United States admitted to a hospital with acute myocardial infarction in 2008.},

  abstract = {The present paper deals with sequential designs intended to balance the allocations of two competing treatments in the presence of prognostic factors. After giving a theoretical framework on the optimality of balanced designs that can arise when covariates are taken into account, we propose a new family of covariate-adaptive randomized designs that represents higher order approximation to balance treatments, both globally and also across covariates. We derive the theoretical properties of the suggested designs in terms of loss of precision and predictability. The performance of this proposal is illustrated through a simulation study and compared with those of other procedures suggested in the literature.},

  abstract = {We compared different growth models parameterizations regarding (i) adjustment of weight-for-height, as denoted by body mass index (BMI); (ii) adjustment for different covariates, ie, age or height; and (iii) the use of different smoothing methods, ie, polynomial, fractional polynomial, or linear splines. A total of 11 459 measurements of weight and height from 719 participants were used, obtained from the EPITeen cohort at 13, 17, and 21 years, and extracted from child health books. The individual growth curves were modeled using mixed-effects polynomial, fractional polynomial, and linear splines, and each model parameterization included as covariate age or height. The goodness-of-fit of the model parametrizations was compared using the relative squared error (RSE) and the relative absolute error (RAE). The adjustment of weight-for-height as denoted by BMI was found to be biased, especially for extreme values of height and presented the worst fit indexes from all model parameterizations tested (RSE = 12.46\%; RAE = 22.63\%). Regardless of the smoothing method, the weight-for-height retrieved the best fit indexes in comparison to the adjustment for age. With regard to the smoothing methods and comparing weight-for-height model parameterizations, the fractional polynomial model performed better (RSE = 0.75\%; RAE = 5.70\%), followed by linear splines (RSE = 0.77\%; RAE = 5.82\%), and conventional polynomial (RSE = 0.91\%; RAE = 6.82\%). Therefore, growth modeling in pediatric age should be based on the modeling of weight-for-height because the use of BMI leaves residual confounding for height. Regarding the smoothing methods, although differences were relatively small, the fractional polynomials performed better in comparison to conventional polynomials and linear splines.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models provide individualized outcome predictions to inform patient counseling and clinical decision making. External validation is the process of examining a prediction model's performance in data independent to that used for model development. Current external validation studies often suffer from small sample sizes, and subsequently imprecise estimates of a model's predictive performance. To address this, we propose how to determine the minimum sample size needed for external validation of a clinical prediction model with a continuous outcome. Four criteria are proposed, that target precise estimates of (i) R2 (the proportion of variance explained), (ii) calibration-in-the-large (agreement between predicted and observed outcome values on average), (iii) calibration slope (agreement between predicted and observed values across the range of predicted values), and (iv) the variance of observed outcome values. Closed-form sample size solutions are derived for each criterion, which require the user to specify anticipated values of the model's performance (in particular R2) and the outcome variance in the external validation dataset. A sensible starting point is to base values on those for the model development study, as obtained from the publication or study authors. The largest sample size required to meet all four criteria is the recommended minimum sample size needed in the external validation dataset. The calculations can also be applied to estimate expected precision when an existing dataset with a fixed sample size is available, to help gauge if it is adequate. We illustrate the proposed methods on a case-study predicting fat-free mass in children.},

  abstract = {Clinicians have difficulty predicting need for hospitalization of children with acute asthma exacerbations. The objective of this study was to develop and internally validate a multivariable asthma prediction rule (APR) to inform hospitalization decision making in children aged 5-17 years with acute asthma exacerbations. Between April 2008 and February 2013 we enrolled a prospective cohort of patients aged 5-17 years with asthma who presented to our pediatric emergency department with acute exacerbations. Predictors for APR modeling included 15 demographic characteristics, asthma chronic control measures, and pulmonary examination findings in participants at the time of triage and before treatment. The primary outcome variable for APR modeling was need for hospitalization (length of stay {$>$}24 h for those admitted to hospital or relapse for those discharged). A secondary outcome was the hospitalization decision of the clinical team. We used penalized maximum likelihood multiple logistic regression modeling to examine the adjusted association of each predictor variable with the outcome. Backward step-down variable selection techniques were used to yield reduced-form models. Data from 928 of 933 participants were used for prediction rule modeling, with median [interquartile range] age 8.8 [6.9, 11.2] years, 61\% male, and 59\% African-American race. Both full (penalized) and reduced-form models for each outcome calibrated well, with bootstrap-corrected c-indices of 0.74 and 0.73 for need for hospitalization and 0.81 in each case for hospitalization decision. The APR predicts the need for hospitalization of children with acute asthma exacerbations using predictor variables available at the time of presentation to an emergency department.

  abstract = {A large body of epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may promote hypertension. This raises the possibility that vitamin D supplementation could be a simple intervention to reduce blood pressure, but data from prospective, randomized trials are limited. A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted at 4 sites in the United States. We enrolled 534 individuals 18 to 50 years of age with low vitamin D status (25-hydroxyvitamin D levels â¤25 ng/mL) and systolic blood pressure of 120 to 159 mm Hg. Participants were randomized to high-dose (4000 IU/d) versus low-dose (400 IU/d) oral vitamin D3 for 6 months. The primary end point was change in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure. Secondary end points included change in ambulatory diastolic blood pressure and clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The median age was 38 years, and 62\% of participants were men. Forty-six percent of participants were white, and 48\% were black. The median 25-hydroxyvitamin D level at baseline was 15.3 ng/mL. Four-hundred fifty-five participants (85\%) had at least 1 follow-up blood pressure measurement; 383 participants (72\%) completed the full 6-month study. At the end of the study, there was no significant difference in the primary end point (change in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure, -0.8 versus -1.6 mm Hg in the high-dose and low-dose arms; P=0.71) or in any of the secondary end points. Furthermore, there was no evidence of association between change in 25-hydroxyvitamin D and change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure at 6 months (Spearman correlation coefficient, -0.05, P=0.34). Results were consistent across prespecified subgroups. Vitamin D supplementation did not reduce blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension or stage I hypertension and vitamin D deficiency. Our findings suggest that the association between vitamin D status and elevated blood pressure noted in observational studies is not causal. http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Prospective longitudinal outcomes registries are at the center of evidence-driven health care reform. Obtaining real-world outcomes data at 12 months can be costly and challenging. In the present study, the authors analyzed whether 3-month outcome measurements sufficiently represent 12-month outcomes for patients with degenerative lumbar disease undergoing surgery. METHODS Data from 3073 patients undergoing elective spine surgery for degenerative lumbar disease were entered into a prospective multicenter registry (N(2)QOD). Baseline, 3-month, and 12-month follow-up Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were recorded. The absolute differences between actual 12- and 3-month ODI scores was evaluated. Additionally, the authors analyzed the absolute difference between actual 12-month ODI scores and a model-predicted 12-month ODI score (the model used patients' baseline characteristics and actual 3-month scores). The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for ODI of 12.8 points and the substantial clinical benefit (SCB) for ODI of 18.8 points were used based on the previously published values. The concordance rate of achieving MCID and SCB for ODI at 3-and 12-months was computed. RESULTS The 3-month ODI scores differed from 12-month scores by an absolute difference of 11.9 Â± 10.8, and predictive modeling estimations of 12-month ODI scores differed from actual 12-month scores by a mean (Â± SD) of 10.7 Â± 9.0 points (p = 0.001). Sixty-four percent of patients (n = 1982) achieved an MCID for ODI at 3 months in comparison with 67\% of patients (n = 2088) by 12 months; 51\% (n = 1731) and 61\% (n = 1860) of patients achieved SCB for ODI at 3 months and 12 months, respectively. Almost 20\% of patients had ODI scores that varied at least 20 points (the point span of an ODI functional category) between actual 3- and 12-month values. In the aggregate analysis of achieving MCID, 77\% of patients were concordant and 23\% were discordant in achieving or not achieving MCID at 3 and 12 months. The discordance rates of achieving or not achieving MCID for ODI were in the range of 19\% to 27\% for all diagnoses and treatments (decompression with and without fusion). The positive and negative predictive value of 3-months ODI to predict 12-month ODI was 86\% and 60\% for MCID and 82\% and 67\% for SCB. CONCLUSIONS Based on their findings, the authors conclude the following: 1) Predictive methods for functional outcome based on early patient experience (i.e., baseline and/or 3-month data) should be used to help evaluate the effectiveness of procedures in patient populations, rather than serving as a proxy for long-term individual patient experience. 2) Prospective longitudinal registries need to span at least 12 months to determine the effectiveness of spine care at the individual patient and practitioner level.},

Therefore, it is vital to identify the factors associated with returning to work after lumbar spine surgery. We present a predictive model of ability to return to work (RTW) after lumbar spine surgery for degenerative spine disease. Total 4694 patients undergoing elective spine surgery for degenerative lumbar disease who were employed were entered into a prospective multicenter registry (N2QOD). Baseline and 3-month postoperative patient-reported outcomes: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), EQ-5D, NRS back and leg pain were recorded. The time to RTW was defined as the period between operation time and date of returning to work. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model, including an array of preoperative factors, was fitted for RTW. The model performance was measured by the c-index. Eighty-two percent of patients (n = 3855) returned to work within 3 -months postoperatively. The risk-adjusted predictors of lower likelihood of RTW were preoperatively employed but not working at the time of presentation, those occupied with manual labor, on worker's compensation, on liability insurance, baseline ODI and NRS-BP scores, female sex, African American race, history of diabetes mellitus, and higher ASA grades. The likelihood of RTW within 3 months was higher in patients with higher education level compared with those with less than high school level education. The c-index of our model performance was 0.71. We present a novel predictive model for probability of RTW after lumbar spine surgery. Spine care providers can use this model to educate patients and encourage them in shared decision making regarding the RTW outcome. This will result in better communication between patients and clinicians and improve recovery expectations, which will ultimately increase the likelihood of a positive RTW trajectory.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE In this analysis the authors compare the characteristics of smokers to nonsmokers using demographic, socioeconomic, and comorbidity variables. They also investigate which of these characteristics are most strongly associated with smoking status. Finally, the authors investigate whether the association between known patient risk factors and disability outcome is differentially modified by patient smoking status for those who have undergone surgery for lumbar degeneration. METHODS A total of 7547 patients undergoing degenerative lumbar surgery were entered into a prospective multicenter registry (Quality Outcomes Database [QOD]). A retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected data was conducted. Patients were dichotomized as smokers (current smokers) and nonsmokers. Multivariable logistic regression analysis fitted for patient smoking status and subsequent measurement of variable importance was performed to identify the strongest patient characteristics associated with smoking status. Multivariable linear regression models fitted for 12-month Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores in subsets of smokers and nonsmokers was performed to investigate whether differential effects of risk factors by smoking status might be present. RESULTS In total, 18\% (n = 1365) of patients were smokers and 82\% (n = 6182) were nonsmokers. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, the factors significantly associated with patients' smoking status were sex (p {$<$} 0.0001), age (p {$<$} 0.0001), body mass index (p {$<$} 0.0001), educational status (p {$<$} 0.0001), insurance status (p {$<$} 0.001), and employment/occupation (p = 0.0024). Patients with diabetes had lowers odds of being a smoker (p = 0.0008), while patients with coronary artery disease had greater odds of being a smoker (p = 0.044). Patients' propensity for smoking was also significantly associated with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class (p {$<$} 0.0001), anterior-alone surgical approach (p = 0.018), greater number of levels (p = 0.0246), decompression only (p = 0.0001), and higher baseline ODI score (p {$<$} 0.0001). In a multivariable proportional odds logistic regression model, the adjusted odds ratio of risk factors and direction of improvement in 12-month ODI scores remained similar between the subsets of smokers and nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS Using a large, national, multiinstitutional registry, the authors described the profile of patients who undergo lumbar spine surgery and its association with their smoking status. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers were younger, male, nondiabetic, nonobese patients presenting with leg pain more so than back pain, with higher ASA classes, higher disability, less education, more likely to be unemployed, and with Medicaid/uninsured insurance status. Smoking status did not affect the association between these risk factors and 12-month ODI outcome, suggesting that interventions for modifiable risk factors are equally efficacious between smokers and nonsmokers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The choice of anterior vs posterior approach for degenerative cervical myelopathy that spans multiple segments remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes following the 2 approaches using multicenter prospectively collected data. METHODS: Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) for patients undergoing surgery for 3 to 5 level degenerative cervical myelopathy was analyzed. The anterior group (anterior cervical discectomy [ACDF] or corpectomy [ACCF] with fusion) was compared with posterior cervical fusion. Outcomes included: patient reported outcomes (PROs): neck disability index (NDI), numeric rating scale (NRS) of neck pain and arm pain, EQ-5D, modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score for myelopathy (mJOA), and NASS satisfaction questionnaire; hospital length of stay (LOS), 90-d readmission, and return to work (RTW). Multivariable regression models were fitted for outcomes. RESULTS: Of total 245 patients analyzed, 163 patients underwent anterior surgery (ACDF-116, ACCF-47) and 82 underwent posterior surgery. Patients undergoing an anterior approach had lower odds of having higher LOS (P {$<$} .001, odds ratio 0.16, 95\% confidence interval 0.08-0.30). The 12-mo NDI, EQ-5D, NRS, mJOA, and satisfaction scores as well as 90-d readmission and RTW did not differ significantly between anterior and posterior groups. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing anterior approaches for 3 to 5 level degenerative cervical myelopathy had shorter hospital LOS compared to those undergoing posterior decompression and fusion. Also, patients in both groups exhibited similar long-term PROs, readmission, and RTW rates. Further investigations are needed to compare the differences in longer term reoperation rates and functional outcomes before the clinical superiority of one approach over the other can be established.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This study retrospectively analyzes prospectively collected data. OBJECTIVE: Here, we aim to determine the influence of preoperative and 12-month modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) on satisfaction and understand the change in mJOA severity classification after surgical management of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: DCM is a progressive degenerative spine disease resulting from cervical cord compression. The natural progression of DCM is variable; some patients experience periods of stability, while others rapidly deteriorate following disease onset. The mJOA is commonly used to grade and categorize myelopathy symptoms, but its association with postoperative satisfaction has not been previously explored. METHODS: The quality and outcomes database (QOD) was queried for patients undergoing elective surgery for DCM. Patients were divided into mild (â¥14), moderate (9 to 13), or severe ({$<$}9) categories on the mJOA scores. A McNemar-Bowker test was used to assess whether a significant proportion of patients changed mJOA category between preoperative and 12 months postoperative. A multivariable proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model was fitted with 12-month satisfaction as the outcome of interest. RESULTS: We identified 1963 patients who underwent elective surgery for DCM and completed 12-months follow-ups. Comparing mJOA severity level preoperatively and at 12 months revealed that 55\% remained in the same category, 37\% improved, and 7\% moved to a worse category. After adjusting for baseline and surgery-specific variables, the 12-month mJOA category had the highest impact on patient satisfaction (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001). CONCLUSION: Patient satisfaction is an indispensable tool for measuring quality of care after spine surgery. In this sample, 12-month mJOA category, regardless of preop mJOA, was significantly correlated with satisfaction. Given these findings, it is important to advise patients of the probability that surgery will change their mJOA severity classification and the changes required to achieve postoperative satisfaction.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patient satisfaction with treatment outcome is gaining an increasingly important role in assessing the value of surgical spine care delivery. Nationwide data evaluating the predictors of patient satisfaction in elective cervical spine surgery are lacking. The authors sought to decipher the impacts of the patient, surgical practice, and surgeon on satisfaction with outcome following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). METHODS: The authors queried the Quality Outcomes Database for patients undergoing 1- to 2-level ACDF for degenerative spine disease since 2013. Patient satisfaction with the surgical outcome as measured by the North American Spine Society (NASS) scale comprised the primary outcome. A multivariable proportional odds logistic regression model was constructed with adjustments for baseline patient characteristics and surgical practice and surgeon characteristics as fixed effects. RESULTS: A total of 4148 patients (median age 54 years, 48\% males) with complete 12-month NASS satisfaction data were analyzed. Sixty-seven percent of patients answered that "surgery met their expectations" (n = 2803), while 20\% reported that they "did not improve as much as they had hoped but they would undergo the same operation for the same results" (n = 836). After adjusting for a multitude of patient-specific as well as hospital- and surgeon-related factors, the authors found baseline Neck Disability Index (NDI) score, US geographic region of hospital, patient race, insurance status, symptom duration, and Workers' compensation status to be the most important predictors of patient satisfaction. The discriminative ability of the model was satisfactory (c-index 0.66, overfitting-corrected estimate 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results found baseline NDI score, patient race, insurance status, symptom duration, and Workers' compensation status as well as the geographic region of the hospital to be the most important predictors of long-term patient satisfaction after a 1- to 2-level ACDF. The findings of the present analysis further reinforce the role of preoperative discussion with patients on setting treatment goals and realistic expectations.},

  abstract = {AbstractAlthough commonly encountered, patients with combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension (Cpc-PH) have poorly understood pulmonary vascular properties. The product of pulmonary vascular resistance and compliance, resistance-compliance (RC) time, is a measure of pulmonary vascular physiology. While RC time is lower in postcapillary PH than in precapillary PH, the RC time in Cpc-PH and the effect of pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) on RC time are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that Cpc-PH has an RC time that resembles that in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) more than that in isolated postcapillary PH (Ipc-PH). We analyzed the hemodynamics of 282 consecutive patients with PH referred for right heart catheterization (RHC) with a fluid challenge from 2004 to 2013 (cohort A) and 4,382 patients who underwent RHC between 1998 and 2014 for validation (cohort B). Baseline RC time in Cpc-PH was higher than that in Ipc-PH and lower than that in PAH in both cohorts (P {$<$} 0.001). In cohort A, RC time decreased after fluid challenge in patients with Ipc-PH but not in those with PAH or Cpc-PH (P {$<$} 0.001). In cohort B, the inverse relationship of pulmonary vascular compliance and resistance, as well as that of RC time and PWP, in Cpc-PH was similar to that in PAH and distinct from that in Ipc-PH. Our findings demonstrate that patients with Cpc-PH have pulmonary vascular physiology that resembles that of patients with PAH more than that of Ipc-PH patients. Further study is warranted to identify determinants of vascular remodeling and assess therapeutic response in this subset of PH.},

While several studies have demonstrated increased mortality in patients with mPAP less than that threshold, little is known about the natural history of borderline PH. Objective: To test the hypothesis that patients with borderline PH have decreased survival compared with patients with lower mPAP and frequently develop overt PH and to identify clinical correlates of borderline PH. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study from 1998 to 2014 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, comprising all patients undergoing routine RHC for clinical indication. We extracted demographics, clinical data, invasive hemodynamics, echocardiography, and vital status for all patients. Patients with mPAP values of 18 mm Hg or less, 19 to 24 mm Hg, and at least 25 mm Hg were classified as reference, borderline PH, and PH, respectively. Exposures: Mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Main Outcome and Measures: Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality after adjusting for clinically relevant covariates in a Cox proportional hazards model. Our secondary outcome was the diagnosis of overt PH in patients initially diagnosed with borderline PH. Both outcomes were determined prior to data analysis. Results: We identified 4343 patients (mean [SD] age, 59 [15] years, 51\% women, and 86\% white) among whom the prevalence of PH and borderline PH was 62\% and 18\%, respectively. Advanced age, features of the metabolic syndrome, and chronic heart and lung disease were independently associated with a higher likelihood of borderline PH compared with reference patients in a logistic regression model. After adjusting for 34 covariates in a Cox proportional hazards model, borderline PH was associated with increased mortality compared with reference patients (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.65; P\,=\,.001). The hazard of death increased incrementally with higher mPAP, without an observed threshold. In the 70 patients with borderline PH who underwent a repeated RHC, 43 (61\%) had developed overt PH, with a median increase in mPAP of 5 mm Hg (interquartile range, -1 to 11 mm Hg; P\,{$<$}\,.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Borderline PH is common in patients undergoing RHC and is associated with significant comorbidities, progression to overt PH, and decreased survival. Small increases in mPAP, even at values currently considered normal, are independently associated with increased mortality. Prospective studies are warranted to determine whether early intervention or closer monitoring improves clinical outcomes in these patients.},

It is of great value for study sponsors to have a good understanding of the recruitment process and the event milestones to manage the logistical tasks, which require a considerable amount of resources. The objective of the proposed statistical approach is to predict, as accurately as possible, the timing of an analysis planned once a target number of events is collected. The method takes into account the enrollment, the time to event, and the time to censor processes, using Weibull models in a Bayesian framework. We also consider a possible delay in the event reporting by the investigators, and covariates may also be included. Several metrics can be obtained, such as the probability of study completion at specific timepoints or the credible interval of the date of study completion. The approach was applied to oncology trials, with progression-free survival as primary outcome. A retrospective analysis shows the accuracy of the approach on these examples, as well as the benefit of updating the predictive probability of study completion as data are accumulating or new information becomes available. We also evaluated the performances of the proposed method in a comprehensive simulation study.},

  abstract = {Simulations and Monte Carlo methods serve an important role in modern statistical research. They allow for an examination of the performance of statistical procedures in settings in which analytic and mathematical derivations may not be feasible. A key element in any statistical simulation is the existence of an appropriate data-generating process: one must be able to simulate data from a specified statistical model. We describe data-generating processes for the Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates when event times follow an exponential, Weibull, or Gompertz distribution. We consider three types of time-varying covariates: first, a dichotomous time-varying covariate that can change at most once from untreated to treated (e.g., organ transplant); second, a continuous time-varying covariate such as cumulative exposure at a constant dose to radiation or to a pharmaceutical agent used for a chronic condition; third, a dichotomous time-varying covariate with a subject being able to move repeatedly between treatment states (e.g., current compliance or use of a medication). In each setting, we derive closed-form expressions that allow one to simulate survival times so that survival times are related to a vector of fixed or time-invariant covariates and to a single time-varying covariate. We illustrate the utility of our closed-form expressions for simulating event times by using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the statistical power to detect as statistically significant the effect of different types of binary time-varying covariates. This is compared with the statistical power to detect as statistically significant a binary time-invariant covariate.},

  abstract = {We conducted an extensive set of empirical analyses to examine the effect of the number of events per variable (EPV) on the relative performance of three different methods for assessing the predictive accuracy of a logistic regression model: apparent performance in the analysis sample, split-sample validation, and optimism correction using bootstrap methods. Using a single dataset of patients hospitalized with heart failure, we compared the estimates of discriminatory performance from these methods to those for a very large independent validation sample arising from the same population. As anticipated, the apparent performance was optimistically biased, with the degree of optimism diminishing as the number of events per variable increased. Differences between the bootstrap-corrected approach and the use of an independent validation sample were minimal once the number of events per variable was at least 20. Split-sample assessment resulted in too pessimistic and highly uncertain estimates of model performance. Apparent performance estimates had lower mean squared error compared to split-sample estimates, but the lowest mean squared error was obtained by bootstrap-corrected optimism estimates. For bias, variance, and mean squared error of the performance estimates, the penalty incurred by using split-sample validation was equivalent to reducing the sample size by a proportion equivalent to the proportion of the sample that was withheld for model validation. In conclusion, split-sample validation is inefficient and apparent performance is too optimistic for internal validation of regression-based prediction models. Modern validation methods, such as bootstrap-based optimism correction, are preferable. While these findings may be unsurprising to many statisticians, the results of the current study reinforce what should be considered good statistical practice in the development and validation of clinical prediction models.},

While assessing discrimination is an essential issue in developing and validating binary prediction models, less attention has been paid to methods for assessing model calibration. Calibration refers to the degree of agreement between observed and predicted probabilities and is often assessed by testing for lack-of-fit. The objective of our study was to examine the ability of graphical methods to assess the calibration of logistic regression models. We examined lack of internal calibration, which was related to misspecification of the logistic regression model, and external calibration, which was related to an overfit model or to shrinkage of the linear predictor. We conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations with a locally weighted least squares regression smoother (i.e., the loess algorithm) to examine the ability of graphical methods to assess model calibration. We found that loess-based methods were able to provide evidence of moderate departures from linearity and indicate omission of a moderately strong interaction. Misspecification of the link function was harder to detect. Visual patterns were clearer with higher sample sizes, higher incidence of the outcome, or higher discrimination. Loess-based methods were also able to identify the lack of calibration in external validation samples when an overfit regression model had been used. In conclusion, loess-based smoothing methods are adequate tools to graphically assess calibration and merit wider application.},

  abstract = {In studies with survival or time-to-event outcomes, a competing risk is an event whose occurrence precludes the occurrence of the primary event of interest. Specialized statistical methods must be used to analyze survival data in the presence of competing risks. We conducted a review of randomized controlled trials with survival outcomes that were published in high-impact general medical journals. Of 40 studies that we identified, 31 (77.5\%) were potentially susceptible to competing risks. However, in the majority of these studies, the potential presence of competing risks was not accounted for in the statistical analyses that were described. Of the 31 studies potentially susceptible to competing risks, 24 (77.4\%) reported the results of a KaplanâMeier survival analysis, while only five (16.1\%) reported using cumulative incidence functions to estimate the incidence of the outcome over time in the presence of competing risks. The former approach will tend to result in an overestimate of the incidence of the outcome over time, while the latter approach will result in unbiased estimation of the incidence of the primary outcome over time. We provide recommendations on the analysis and reporting of randomized controlled trials with survival outcomes in the presence of competing risks.  2017 The Authors.

  abstract = {The Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model has become the default method to estimate the incidence of outcomes over time in the presence of competing risks. This model is attractive because it directly relates covariates to the cumulative incidence function (CIF) of the event of interest. An alternative is to combine the different cause-specific hazard functions to obtain the different CIFs. A limitation of the subdistribution hazard approach is that the sum of the cause-specific CIFs can exceed 1 (100\%) for some covariate patterns. Using data on 9479 patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction, we estimated the cumulative incidence of both cardiovascular death and non-cardiovascular death for each patient. We found that when using subdistribution hazard models, approximately 5\% of subjects had an estimated risk of 5-year all-cause death (obtained by combining the two cause-specific CIFs obtained from subdistribution hazard models) that exceeded 1. This phenomenon was avoided by using the two cause-specific hazard models. We provide a proof that the sum of predictions exceeds 1 is a fundamental problem with the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model. We further explored this issue using simulations based on two different types of data-generating process, one based on subdistribution hazard models and other based on cause-specific hazard models. We conclude that care should be taken when using the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model in situations with wide risk distributions or a high cumulative incidence, and if one is interested in the risk of failure from each of the different event types.},

  abstract = {The Cox proportional hazards model is used extensively in clinical and epidemiological research. A key assumption of this model is that of proportional hazards. A variable satisfies the proportional hazards assumption if the effect of that variable on the hazard function is constant over time. When the proportional hazards assumption is violated for a given variable, a common approach is to modify the model so that the regression coefficient associated with the given variable is assumed to be a linear function of time (or of log-time), rather than being constant or fixed. However, this is an unnecessarily restrictive assumption. We describe two different methods to allow a regression coefficient, and thus the hazard ratio, in a Cox model to vary as a flexible function of time. These methods use either fractional polynomials or restricted cubic splines to model the log-hazard ratio as a function of time. We illustrate the utility of these methods using data on 12 705 patients who presented to a hospital emergency department with a primary diagnosis of heart failure. We used a Cox model to assess the association between elevated cardiac troponin at presentation and the hazard of death after adjustment for an extensive set of covariates. SAS code for implementing the restricted cubic spline approach is provided, while an existing Stata function allows for the use of fractional polynomials.},

  abstract = {When a sponsor carries out a single-arm trial of a novel oncology compound, it may wish to assess the efficacy of the compound via comparison of overall survival to an external control arm, constructed using patients included in some retrospective registry. If efficacy of the novel compound is compared to efficacy of physician's choice of chemotherapy, patients in the retrospective registry might qualify for inclusion in the external control arm at multiple different points in time, when they receive different chemotherapy treatments. For example, a patient might qualify at the start of their second, third and fourth lines of therapy. From the start of which line of therapy should this patient's survival be compared to survival of participants in the single-arm trial? Some sponsors have elected to include patients in the external control arm from the last available line of therapy in the retrospective database. Another possibility is to randomly select a line of therapy for each external control arm patient from among those available. In this paper, we show, via probabilistic arguments and also via simulation based on real data, that both of these methods give rise to a bias in favor of the single-arm trial. We further show that this bias can be avoided by instead including external control arm patients multiple times in the external control arm, once for each time they receive qualifying treatment.},

  abstract = {An important question in the evaluation of an additional risk prediction marker is how to interpret a small increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Many researchers believe that a change in AUC is a poor metric because it increases only slightly with the addition of a marker with a large odds ratio. Because it is not possible on purely statistical grounds to choose between the odds ratio and AUC, we invoke decision analysis, which incorporates costs and benefits. For example, a timely estimate of the risk of later non-elective operative delivery can help a woman in labor decide if she wants an early elective cesarean section to avoid greater complications from possible later non-elective operative delivery. A basic risk prediction model for later non-elective operative delivery involves only antepartum markers. Because adding intrapartum markers to this risk prediction model increases AUC by 0.02, we questioned whether this small improvement is worthwhile. A key decision-analytic quantity is the risk threshold, here the risk of later non-elective operative delivery at which a patient would be indifferent between an early elective cesarean section and usual care. For a range of risk thresholds, we found that an increase in the net benefit of risk prediction requires collecting intrapartum marker data on 68 to 124 women for every correct prediction of later non-elective operative delivery. Because data collection is non-invasive, this test tradeoff of 68 to 124 is clinically acceptable, indicating the value of adding intrapartum markers to the risk prediction model.},

  abstract = {Many clinical or prevention studies involve missing or censored outcomes. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods provide a conceptually straightforward approach to estimation when the outcome is partially missing. Methods of implementing ML methods range from the simple to the complex, depending on the type of data and the missing-data mechanism. Simple ML methods for ignorable missing-data mechanisms (when data are missing at random) include complete-case analysis, complete-case analysis with covariate adjustment, survival analysis with covariate adjustment, and analysis via propensity-to-be-missing scores. More complex ML methods for ignorable missing-data mechanisms include the analysis of longitudinal dropouts via a marginal model for continuous data or a conditional model for categorical data. A moderately complex ML method for categorical data with a saturated model and either ignorable or nonignorable missing-data mechanisms is a perfect fit analysis, an algebraic method involving closed-form estimates and variances. A complex and flexible ML method with categorical data and either ignorable or nonignorable missing-data mechanisms is the method of composite linear models, a matrix method requiring specialized software. Except for the method of composite linear models, which can involve challenging matrix specifications, the implementation of these ML methods ranges in difficulty from easy to moderate.},

We present a uniform general approach to causality problems derived from the axiomatic foundations of the Bayesian statistical framework. In this approach, causality statements are viewed as hypotheses, or models, about the world and the fundamental object to be computed is the posterior distribution of the causal hypotheses, given the data and the background knowledge. Computation of the posterior, illustrated here in simple examples, may involve complex probabilistic modeling but this is no different than in any other Bayesian modeling situation. The main advantage of the approach is its connection to the axiomatic foundations of the Bayesian framework, and the general uniformity with which it can be applied to a variety of causality settings, ranging from specific to general cases, or from causes of effects to effects of causes.},

However, this data type is common place in the natural and health sciences where repeated ratings are recorded on the same subject. To analyse these data, this paper considers a transition (Markov) model where the rating of a subject at one time depends explicitly on the observed rating at the previous point of time by incorporating the previous rating as a predictor variable. Complications arise with adequate handling of data at the first observation (t=1), as there is no prior observation to use as a predictor. To overcome this, it is postulated the existence of a rating at time t=0; however it is treated as âmissing dataâ and the expectationâmaximisation algorithm used to accommodate this. The particular benefits of this method are shown for shorter time series.},

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation affects more than 2 million people in the United States and accounts for nearly 1\% of emergency department (ED) visits. Physicians have little information to guide risk stratification of patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation and admit more than 65\%. Our aim is to assess whether data available in the ED management of symptomatic atrial fibrillation can estimate a patient's risk of experiencing a 30-day adverse event.We systematically reviewed the electronic medical records of all ED patients presenting with symptomatic atrial fibrillation between August 2005 and July 2008. Predefined adverse outcomes included 30-day ED return visit, unscheduled hospitalization, cardiovascular complication, or death. We performed multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of 30-day adverse events. The model was validated with 300 bootstrap replications.During the 3-year study period, 914 patients accounted for 1,228 ED visits. Eighty patients were excluded for non-atrial-fibrillation-related complaints and 2 patients had no follow-up recorded. Of 832 eligible patients, 216 (25.9\%) experienced at least 1 of the 30-day adverse events. Increasing age (odds ratio [OR] 1.20 per decade; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 1.36 per decade), complaint of dyspnea (OR 1.57; 95\% CI 1.12 to 2.20), smokers (OR 2.35; 95\% CI 1.47 to 3.76), inadequate ventricular rate control (OR 1.58; 95\% CI 1.13 to 2.21), and patients receiving Î²-blockers (OR 1.44; 95\% CI 1.02 to 2.04) were independently associated with higher risk for adverse events. C-index was 0.67.In ED patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation, increased age, inadequate ED ventricular rate control, dyspnea, smoking, and Î²-blocker treatment were associated with an increased risk of a 30-day adverse event.},

  abstract = {There is wide variation in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the emergency department (ED). We aimed to derive and internally validate the first prospective, ED-based clinical decision aid to identify patients with AF at low risk for 30-day adverse events. We performed a prospective cohort study at a university-affiliated tertiary-care ED. Patients were enrolled from June 9, 2010, to February 28, 2013, and followed for 30 days. We enrolled a convenience sample of patients in ED presenting with symptomatic AF. Candidate predictors were based on ED data available in the first 2 hours. The decision aid was derived using model approximation (preconditioning) followed by strong bootstrap internal validation. We used an ordinal outcome hierarchy defined as the incidence of the most severe adverse event within 30 days of the ED evaluation. Of 497 patients enrolled, stroke and AF-related death occurred in 13 (3\%) and 4 ({$<$}1\%) patients, respectively. The decision aid included the following: age, triage vitals (systolic blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen requirement), medical history (heart failure, home sotalol use, previous percutaneous coronary intervention, electrical cardioversion, cardiac ablation, frequency of AF symptoms), and ED data (2 hours heart rate, chest radiograph results, hemoglobin, creatinine, and brain natriuretic peptide). The decision aid's c-statistic in predicting any 30-day adverse event was 0.7 (95\% confidence interval 0.65, 0.76). In conclusion, in patients with AF in the ED, Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter Outcome Risk Determination provides the first evidence-based decision aid for identifying patients who are at low risk for 30-day adverse events and candidates for safe discharge.

  abstract = {In many time-to-event studies, the event of interest is recurrent. Here, the data for each sample unit correspond to a series of gap times between the subsequent events. Given a limited follow-up period, the last gap time might be right-censored. In contrast to classical analysis, gap times and censoring times cannot be assumed independent, i.e., the sequential nature of the data induces dependent censoring. Also, the number of recurrences typically varies among sample units leading to unbalanced data. To model the association pattern between gap times, so far only parametric margins combined with the restrictive class of Archimedean copulas have been considered. Here, taking the specific data features into account, we extend existing work in several directions: we allow for nonparametric margins and consider the flexible class of D-vine copulas. A global and sequential (one- and two-stage) likelihood approach are suggested. We discuss the computational efficiency of each estimation strategy. Extensive simulations show good finite sample performance of the proposed methodology. It is used to analyze the association of recurrent asthma attacks in children. The analysis reveals that a D-vine copula detects relevant insights, on how dependence changes in strength and type over time.},

  abstract = {Many clinical studies (eg, cardiovascular outcome trials) investigate the effect of an intervention on multiple event time outcomes. The most common method of analysis is a so-called â compositeâ analysis of a composite outcome defined as the time to the first component event. Other approaches have been proposed, including the win ratio (or win difference) for ordered outcomes and the application of the Wei-Lachin test. Herein, we assess the influence of the marginal and joint distributions of the component events, and their correlation structures, on the operating characteristics of these methods for the analysis of multiple events. The operating characteristics are investigated using a bivariate exponential model with a shared frailty, under which these properties are obtained in closed form. While the composite time-to-first-event analysis provides an unbiased test of the hypothesis of equality of the distribution of the time to first event, we show that it can provide a biased test of the joint null hypothesis of equal marginal hazards when the correlation of event times differs between groups. The same applies to the win ratio. However, the operating characteristics of the Wei-Lachin or other tests of the joint equality of the marginal hazards are unaffected. Furthermore, when the correlations are equal, the Wei-Lachin test is more powerful to detect a difference in marginal hazards than the composite analysis test. Careful consideration of the properties of the various methods for analysis of composite outcome measures are in order before adopting one as primary analysis in a clinical study.},

First, dimensionality is reduced using a technique such as principal component analysis, followed by a group comparison using a t-test or analysis of variance. Although this practice is often discouraged, the statistical properties of this procedure are not well understood, starting with the hypothesis being tested. We suggest that this approach might be considering two distinct hypotheses, one of which is a global test of no differences in the mean vectors, and the other being a focused test of a specific linear combination where the coefficients have been estimated from the data. We study the asymptotic properties of the two-sample t-statistic for these two scenarios, assuming a nonsparse setting. We show that the size of the global test agrees with the presumed level but that the test has poor power. In contrast, the size of the focused test can be arbitrarily distorted with certain mean and covariance structures. A simple method is provided to correct the size of the focused test. Data analyses and simulations are used to illustrate the results. Recommendations on the use of this two-step method and the related use of principal components for prediction are provided.},

  abstract = {Biobanks linked to electronic health records provide rich resources for health-related research. With improvements in administrative and informatics infrastructure, the availability and utility of data from biobanks have dramatically increased. In this paper, we first aim to characterize the current landscape of available biobanks and to describe specific biobanks, including their place of origin, size, and data types. The development and accessibility of large-scale biorepositories provide the opportunity to accelerate agnostic searches, expedite discoveries, and conduct hypothesis-generating studies of disease-treatment, disease-exposure, and disease-gene associations. Rather than designing and implementing a single study focused on a few targeted hypotheses, researchers can potentially use biobanks' existing resources to answer an expanded selection of exploratory questions as quickly as they can analyze them. However, there are many obvious and subtle challenges with the design and analysis of biobank-based studies. Our second aim is to discuss statistical issues related to biobank research such as study design, sampling strategy, phenotype identification, and missing data. We focus our discussion on biobanks that are linked to electronic health records. Some of the analytic issues are illustrated using data from the Michigan Genomics Initiative and UK Biobank, two biobanks with two different recruitment mechanisms. We summarize the current body of literature for addressing these challenges and discuss some standing open problems. This work complements and extends recent reviews about biobank-based research and serves as a resource catalog with analytical and practical guidance for statisticians, epidemiologists, and other medical researchers pursuing research using biobanks.},

  abstract = {Objective setting is a necessary early step in the development of a clinical trial. ICH E9(R1) notes that the clinical objectives of a trial lead directly to the choice of estimands but barely discusses objectives themselves. Indeed, there is very little guidance anywhere in literature about objectives in clinical trials. This article identifies the substantial overlap between description of estimands and high quality definitions of objectives. It consequently shows that the estimand is decided by the precise choice of trial objective, and that therefore estimand decisions should be made at the objective level. The Detailed Clinical Objectives approach is proposed to support this. It emphasises clarity, specificity and a clinical focus when choosing and documenting objectives. Template text and examples are included to provide guidance on how it can be used in real trials. Finally, we describe objective-driven trial design, emphasising how strong objective setting establishes an important foundation for rigorous trial design discussions, logistical and operational decision-making during trial preparations, and clear communication of results and conclusions at the end of the trial. Highlighting the distinctions between objectives and estimands, we note how an objective-based framework can build on the ICH E9(R1) estimand framework to address many of its unanswered questions.},

  abstract = {The debate on the use and misuse of  P  values has risen and fallen throughout their almost century-long existence in scientific discovery. Over the past few years, the debate has again received front-page attention, particularly through the public reminder by the American Statistical Association on how  P  values should be used and interpreted. At the core of the issue lies a fault in the way that scientific evidence is dichotomized and research is subsequently reported, and this fault is exacerbated by researchers giving license to statistical models to do scientific inference. This paper highlights a different approach to handling the evidence collected during a randomized controlled trial, one that does not dichotomize, but rather reports the evidence collected. Through the use of a coin flipping experiment and reanalysis of real-world data, the traditional approach of testing null hypothesis significance is contrasted with a Bayesian approach. This paper is meant to be understood by those who rely on statistical models to draw conclusions from data, but are not statisticians and may therefore not be able to grasp the debate that is primarily led by statisticians.

  note = {Using priors forces us to be more specific and explicit about what we mean when we say that something is unknown... the Bayesian approach does not attempt to identify a fixed value for the parameters and dichotomize the world into significant and nonsignificant, but rather relies on the researcher to do the scientific inference and not to delegate this obligation to the statistical model... the NHST approach is rooted in the idea of being able to redo the experiment many times (so as to get a sampling distribution).~ Even if we can rely on theoretical results to get this sampling distribution without actually going back in time and redoing the experiment, the underlying idea can be somewhat problematic.~ What do we mean by redoing an experiment? Can we redo a randomized controlled trial while keeping all things equal and recruiting a new sample from the study population?... Once we remove ourselves from the dichotomization of evidence, other things start to take precedence: critically assessing the models chosen, evaluating the quality of the data, interpreting the real-world impact of the results, etc.}

There are currently over 400 clinical trials (phase 2 and 3) of treatments for COVID-19 registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Covariate adjustment is a statistical analysis method with potential to improve precision and reduce the required sample size for a substantial number of these trials. Though covariate adjustment is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, it is underutilized, especially for the types of outcomes (binary, ordinal and time-to-event) that are common in COVID-19 trials. To demonstrate the potential value added by covariate adjustment in this context, we simulated two-arm, randomized trials comparing a hypothetical COVID-19 treatment versus standard of care, where the primary outcome is binary, ordinal, or time-to-event. Our simulated distributions are derived from two sources: longitudinal data on over 500 patients hospitalized at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital, and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) preliminary description of 2449 cases. We found substantial precision gains from using covariate adjustment--equivalent to 9-21\% reductions in the required sample size to achieve a desired power--for a variety of estimands (targets of inference) when the trial sample size was at least 200. We provide an R package and practical recommendations for implementing covariate adjustment. The estimators that we consider are robust to model misspecification.},

The method assumes independence between subjects; first-order antedependence within subjects; exponential family distributions for the first outcome on each subject and for the subsequent conditional distributions; and linearity of the expectations of the conditional distributions. We demonstrate application of the method in an analysis of seizure counts and in a study to evaluate the performance of transplant centers. Simulations for both studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed likelihood based approach; however, they also demonstrate better than anticipated performance for GEE.},

Empirical powers of the generalized Savage test and generalized Wilcoxon test with uncensored data are compared to those with censored data containing approximately the same number of uncensored observations. Large sample relative efficiencies are calculated for a Lehmann family of alternatives.

The flexibility of the Bayesian approach allows for building designs of clinical trials that have good properties of any desired sort. Examples include maximizing effective treatment of patients in the trial, maximizing information about the slope of a doseâresponse curve, minimizing costs, minimizing the number of patients treated, minimizing the length of the trial and combinations of these desiderata. They also include standard frequentist operating characteristics when these are important considerations. Posterior probabilities are updated via Bayesâ theorem on the basis of accumulating data. These are used to effect modifications of the trialâs course, including stopping accrual, extending accrual beyond that originally planned, dropping treatment arms, adding arms, etc. An important aspect of the approach I advocate is modeling the relationship between a trialâs primary endpoint and early indications of patient performanceâauxiliary endpoints. This has several highly desirable consequences. One is that it improves the efficiency of adaptive trials because information is available sooner than otherwise.},

Everything that is known is taken as given and all probabilities are calculated conditionally on known values. ... in contrast to the frequentist approach, only the probabilities of the observed results matter. ... The continuous learning that is possible in the Bayesian approach enables investigators to modify trials in midcourse. ... it is possible to learn from small samples, depending on the results, ... it is possible to adapt to what is learned to enable better treatment of patients. ... subjectivity in prior distributions is explicit and open to examination (and critique) by all. ...

It is increasingly being used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions ranging from clinical therapy to national public health legislation. Whereas the design shares many properties of regression-based approaches in other epidemiological studies, there are a range of unique features of time series data that require additional methodological considerations. In this tutorial we use a worked example to demonstrate a robust approach to ITS analysis using segmented regression. We begin by describing the design and considering when ITS is an appropriate design choice. We then discuss the essential, yet often omitted, step of proposing the impact model a priori. Subsequently, we demonstrate the approach to statistical analysis including the main segmented regression model. Finally we describe the main methodological issues associated with ITS analysis: over-dispersion of time series data, autocorrelation, adjusting for seasonal trends and controlling for time-varying confounders, and we also outline some of the more complex design adaptations that can be used to strengthen the basic ITS design.},

Classes of contaminations that are considered include (i) all possible contaminations, (ii) all symmetric, unimodal contaminations, and (iii) all contaminations such that Ï is unimodal. Two issues in robust Bayesian analysis are studied. The first is that of determining the range of posterior probabilities of a set as Ï ranges over the Îµ-contamination class. The second, more extensively studied, issue is that of selecting, in a data dependent fashion, a "good" prior distribution (the Type-II maximum likelihood prior) from the Îµ-contamination class, and using this prior in the subsequent analysis. Relationships and applications to empirical Bayes analysis are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Testing of precise (point or small interval) hypotheses is reviewed, with special emphasis placed on exploring the dramatic conflict between conditional measures (Bayes factors and posterior probabilities) and the classical P-value (or observed significance level). This conflict is highlighted by finding lower bounds on the conditional measures over wide classes of priors, in normal and binomial situations, lower bounds, which are much larger than the P-value; this leads to the recommendation of several alternatives to P-values. Results are also given concerning the validity of approximating an interval null by a point null. The overall discussion features critical examination of issues such as the probability of objective testing and the possibility of testing from confidence sets.},

Some statisticians argue that the implied logic concerning a small P-value is compelling: âEither H0 is true and a rare event has occurred, or H0 is false.â ~One could again argue against this reasoning as addressing the wrong question, but there is a more obvious major flaw: the ârare eventâ whose probability is being calculated under H0 is \emph{not} the event of observing the actual data x0, but the event E = \{possible data x: |T(x)| {$>$}= |T(x0)|\}. ~The inclusion of all data âmore extremeâ than the actual x0 is a curious step, and one which we have seen no remotely convincing justification. â¦ the âlogic of surpriseâ cannot differentiate between x0 and E â¦}

To demonstrate the significance of an overall clinical benefit, it is sufficient to assess the test problem formulated for the composite. However, the effect observed for the composite does not necessarily reflect the effects for the components. Therefore, it would be desirable that the sample size for clinical trials using composite endpoints provides enough power not only to detect a clinically relevant superiority for the composite but also to address the components in an adequate way. The single components of a composite endpoint assessed as time-to-first-event define competing risks. We consider multiple test problems based on the cause-specific hazards of competing events to address the problem of analyzing both a composite endpoint and its components. Thereby, we use sequentially rejective test procedures to reduce the power loss to a minimum. We show how to calculate the sample size for the given multiple test problem by using a simply applicable simulation tool in SAS. Our ideas are illustrated by two clinical study examples.},

Although some attempts were made to standardize study designs, this was hindered by the ferocity of the pandemic and the need to set up clinical trials quickly. We take the view that a successful treatment of COVID-19 patients (i) increases the probability of a recovery or improvement within a certain time interval, say 28 days; (ii) aims to expedite favorable events within this time frame; and (iii) does not increase mortality over this time period. On this background, we discuss the choice of endpoint and its analysis. Furthermore, we consider consequences of this choice for other design aspects including sample size and power and provide some guidance on the application of adaptive designs in this particular context.},

  abstract = {In randomised trials, rather than comparing randomised groups directly some researchers carry out a significance test comparing a baseline with a final measurement separately in each group. We give several examples where this has been done. We use simulation to demonstrate that the procedure is invalid and also show this algebraically. This approach is biased and invalid, producing conclusions which are, potentially, highly misleading. The actual alpha level of this procedure can be as high as 0.50 for two groups and 0.75 for three. Randomised groups should be compared directly by two-sample methods and separate tests against baseline are highly misleading.},

  abstract = {Electronic health records are a valuable data source for investigating health-related questions, and propensity score analysis has become an increasingly popular approach to address confounding bias in such investigations. However, because electronic health records are typically routinely recorded as part of standard clinical care, there are often missing values, particularly for potential confounders. In our motivating studyâusing electronic health records to investigate the effect of renin-angiotensin system blockers on the risk of acute kidney injuryâtwo key confounders, ethnicity and chronic kidney disease stage, have 59\% and 53\% missing data, respectively. The missingness pattern approach (MPA), a variant of the missing indicator approach, has been proposed as a method for handling partially observed confounders in propensity score analysis. In the MPA, propensity scores are estimated separately for each missingness pattern present in the data. Although the assumptions underlying the validity of the MPA are stated in the literature, it can be difficult in practice to assess their plausibility. In this article, we explore the MPA's underlying assumptions by using causal diagrams to assess their plausibility in a range of simple scenarios, drawing general conclusions about situations in which they are likely to be violated. We present a framework providing practical guidance for assessing whether the MPA's assumptions are plausible in a particular setting and thus deciding when the MPA is appropriate. We apply our framework to our motivating study, showing that the MPA's underlying assumptions appear reasonable, and we demonstrate the application of MPA to this study.},

  abstract = {Causal inference methods are gaining increasing prominence in pharmaceutical drug development in light of the recently published addendum on estimands and sensitivity analysis in clinical trials to the E9 guideline of the International Council for Harmonisation. The E9 addendum emphasises the need to account for post-randomization or âintercurrentâ events that can potentially influence the interpretation of a treatment effect estimate at a trial's conclusion. Instrumental Variables (IV) methods have been used extensively in economics, epidemiology, and academic clinical studies for âcausal inference,â but less so in the pharmaceutical industry setting until now. In this tutorial article we review the basic tools for causal inference, including graphical diagrams and potential outcomes, as well as several conceptual frameworks that an IV analysis can sit within. We discuss in detail how to map these approaches to the Treatment Policy, Principal Stratum and Hypothetical âestimand strategiesâ introduced in the E9 addendum, and provide details of their implementation using standard regression models. Specific attention is given to discussing the assumptions each estimation strategy relies on in order to be consistent, the extent to which they can be empirically tested and sensitivity analyses in which specific assumptions can be relaxed. We finish by applying the methods described to simulated data closely matching two recent pharmaceutical trials to further motivate and clarify the ideas.},

  abstract = {In clinical trials with time-to-event outcomes, it is common to estimate the marginal hazard ratio from the proportional hazards model, even when the proportional hazards assumption is not valid. This is unavoidable from the perspective that the estimator must be specified a priori if probability statements about treatment effect estimates are desired. Marginal hazard ratio estimates under non-proportional hazards are still useful, as they can be considered to be average treatment effect estimates over the support of the data. However, as many have shown, under non-proportional hazard, the âusualâ unweighted marginal hazard ratio estimate is a function of the censoring distribution, which is not normally considered to be scientifically relevant when describing the treatment effect. In addition, in many practical settings, the censoring distribution is only conditionally independent (e.g., differing across treatment arms), which further complicates the interpretation. In this paper, we investigate an estimator of the hazard ratio that removes the influence of censoring and propose a consistent robust variance estimator. We compare the coverage probability of the estimator to both the usual Cox model estimator and an estimator proposed by Xu and O'Quigley (2000) when censoring is independent of the covariate. The new estimator should be used for inference that does not depend on the censoring distribution. It is particularly relevant to adaptive clinical trials where, by design, censoring distributions differ across treatment arms. Copyright Â© 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Context The role of diet composition in response to overeating and energy dissipation in humans is unclear. Objective To evaluate the effects of overconsumption of low, normal, and high protein diets on weight gain, energy expenditure, and body composition. Design, Setting, and Participants A single-blind, randomized controlled trial of 25 US healthy, weight-stable male and female volunteers, aged 18 to 35 years with a body mass index between 19 and 30. The first participant was admitted to the inpatient metabolic unit in June 2005 and the last in October 2007. Intervention After consuming a weight-stabilizing diet for 13 to 25 days, participants were randomized to diets containing 5\% of energy from protein (low protein), 15\% (normal protein), or 25\% (high protein), which they were overfed during the last 8 weeks of their 10- to 12-week stay in the inpatient metabolic unit. Compared with energy intake during the weight stabilization period, the protein diets provided approximately 40\% more energy intake, which corresponds to 954 kcal/d (95\% CI, 884â1022 kcal/d). Main Outcome Measures Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry biweekly, resting energy expenditure was measured weekly by ventilated hood, and total energy expenditure by doubly labeled water prior to the overeating and weight stabilization periods and at weeks 7 to 8. Results Overeating produced significantly less weight gain in the low protein diet group (3.16 kg; 95\% CI, 1.88â4.44 kg) compared with the normal protein diet group (6.05 kg; 95\% CI, 4.84â7.26 kg) or the high protein diet group (6.51 kg; 95\% CI, 5.23â7.79 kg) (P=.002). Body fat increased similarly in all 3 protein diet groups and represented 50\% to more than 90\% of the excess stored calories. Resting energy expenditure, total energy expenditure, and body protein did not increase during overfeeding with the low protein diet. In contrast, resting energy expenditure (normal protein diet: 160 kcal/d [95\% CI, 102â218 kcal/d]; high protein diet: 227 kcal/d [95\% CI, 165â289 kcal/d]) and body protein (lean body mass) (normal protein diet: 2.87 kg [95\% CI, 2.11â3.62 kg]; high protein diet: 3.18 kg [95\% CI, 2.37â3.98 kg]) increased significantly with the normal and high protein diets. Conclusions Among persons living in a controlled setting, calories alone account for the increase in fat; protein affected energy expenditure and storage of lean body mass, but not body fat storage.},

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) treatment produces beneficial remodeling in nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM). We assessed the hypothesis that interstitial myocardial fibrosis measured with the use of CMR predicts left ventricular (LV) beneficial remodeling in NIDCM after heart failure (HF) treatment including MRAs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve patients with NIDCM, on stable beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor-blocking therapy, were studied before and after 6-29 months of treatment with MRAs, by means of CMR assessment of LV structure, function, and T1 from standard Look-Locker sequences (T1LL). All patients had depressed cardiac function, dilated left ventricles, and no visual LGE. After adding MRA to HF treatment, the LV ejection fraction increased and the LV end-systolic volume index (LV end-systolic volume/m2) decreased in all patients (P\,{$<$}\,.0001). This this was inversely proportional to the baseline myocardial T1LL (r\,=\,-0.65; P\,=\,.02). CONCLUSION: Myocardial T1LL, in the absence of visually detectable LGE, was quantitatively related to the degree of beneficial LV remodeling achieved in response to adding MRA to a HF regimen.},

And, as stated by Dennis Lindley in a more general context, â [t]he simple practical question of 'What size of sample should I take' is often posed to a statistician, and it is a question that is embarrassingly difficult to answer.â Historically, simulation has been the primary option for determining sample sizes for adaptive Phase I trials, and although useful, can be problematic and time-consuming when a sample size is needed relatively quickly. We propose a computationally fast and simple approach that uses Beta distributions to approximate the posterior distributions of DLT rates of each dose and determines an appropriate sample size through posterior coverage rates. We provide sample sizes produced by our methods for a vast number of realistic Phase I trial settings and demonstrate that our sample sizes are generally larger than those produced by a competing approach that is based upon the nonparametric optimal design.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) treatment produces beneficial left ventricular (LV) remodeling in nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM). This study addressed the timing of maximal beneficial LV remodeling in NIDCM when adding MRA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 12 patients with NIDCM on stable Î²-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor-blocking therapy who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging before and after 6-31 months of continuous MRA therapy. RESULTS: At baseline, the LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was 24\% (19-27); median [interquartile range]. The LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) was 63 ml (57-76) and the LV stroke volume index (LVSVI) was 19 ml (14-21), all depressed. After adding MRA to the HF regimen, the LVEF increased to 47\% (42-52), with a decrease in LVESVI to 36 ml (33-45) and increase in LVSVI to 36 ml (28-39) (for each, P \,{$<$} 0\,.0001). Using generalized least squares analysis, the maximal beneficial remodeling (defined by maximal increase in LVEF, the maximal decrease in LVESVI and maximal increase in LVSVI) was achieved after approximately 12-16 months of MRA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Adding MRA to a standard medical regimen for NIDCM resulted in beneficial LV remodeling. The maximal beneficial remodeling was achieved with 12-16 months of MRA therapy. These results have implications for the timing of other advanced therapies, such as placing internal cardioverter-defibrillators.},

  abstract = {An initial proposal was made to start 30 monkeys in the run-in period of a preclinical translational research study, to have 24 or more animals qualify for randomization in the subsequent treatment period. Based upon data from previous studies, Bayesian posterior prediction indicated that successful enrolment was highly unlikely. At least 67 animals were required to achieve an acceptable posterior predictive probability of success. Importantly, we leveraged these feasibility analyses to introduce our preclinical scientist collaborators to a Bayesian strategy for probability-based decision making. We provided them with a generous helping of graphics to effectively and efficiently illustrate Bayesian concepts and methods. We present our 4P strategy for collaboration with preclinical scientists: patience, persistence, positioning, and privilege. We discuss the alignment of the Bayesian and 4P strategies with goals common to pharmaceutical researchers: scientific innovation; stochastic intelligence and statistical literacy of team members; team collaboration and collegial partnerships; ethical acuity; and fiscal stewardship. Our article is as much about successfully reaching out to preclinical scientists, and introducing them to the Bayesian strategy, as it is about that strategy successfully addressing the animal enrolment question.

  abstract = {The pretest-posttest control group design can be analyzed with the posttest as dependent variable and the pretest as covariate (ANCOVA) or with the difference between posttest and pretest as dependent variable (CHANGE). These 2 methods can give contradictory results if groups differ at pretest, a phenomenon that is known as Lord's paradox. Literature claims that ANCOVA is preferable if treatment assignment is based on randomization or on the pretest and questionable for preexisting groups. Some literature suggests that Lord's paradox has to do with measurement error in the pretest. This article shows two new things: First, the claims are confirmed by proving the mathematical equivalence of ANCOVA to a repeated measures model without group effect at pretest. Second, correction for measurement error in the pretest is shown to lead back to ANCOVA or to CHANGE, depending on the assumed absence or presence of a true group difference at pretest. These two new theoretical results are illustrated with multilevel (mixed) regression and structural equation modeling of data from two studies.},

ROC curves lack or obscure several quantities that are necessary for evaluating the operational effectiveness of diagnostic tests. ... ROC curves were first used to check how radio {$<$}i{$>$}receivers{$<$}/i{$>$} (like radar receivers) operated over a range of frequencies. ... This is not how most ROC curves are used now, particularly in medicine. The receiver of a diagnostic measurement ... wants to make a decision based on some x\_c, and is not especially interested in how well he would have done had he used some different cutoff."; in the discussion David Hand states "when integrating to yield the overall AUC measure, it is necessary to decide what weight to give each value in the integration. The AUC implicitly does this using a weighting derived empirically from the data. This is nonsensical. The relative importance of misclassifying a case as a noncase, compared to the reverse, cannot come from the data itself. It must come externally, from considerations of the severity one attaches to the different kinds of misclassifications."; see Lin, Kvam, Lu Stat in Med 28:798-813;2009}

Statistical thinking uses probabilistic descriptions of variability in (1) inductive reasoning and (2) analysis of procedures for data collection, prediction, and scientific inference. ... The essential component that characterizes the discipline is the introduction of probability to describe variation in order to provide a good solution to a problem involving the reduction of data for a specific purpose. ... (we) elaborate our definition of statistical thinking by stating that it involves two principles: 1. Statistical models of regularity and variability in data may be used to express knowledge and uncertainty about a signal in the presence of noise, via inductive reasoning. 2.

By incorporating multiple and varying types of clinical outcomes they provide a test for the overall efficacy of the treatment. Our objective is to compare the performance of popular composite end points in terms of statistical power and describe the uncertainty in these power estimates and issues concerning implementation. We consider several composites that incorporate outcomes of varying types (eg, time to event, categorical, and continuous). Data are simulated for 5 outcomes, and the composites are derived and compared. Power is evaluated graphically while varying the size of the treatment effects, thus describing the sensitivity of power to varying circumstances and eventualities such as opposing effects. The average \emph{z} score offered the most power, although caution should be exercised when opposing effects are anticipated. Results emphasize the importance of an a priori assessment of power and scientific basis for construction, including the weighting of individual outcomes deduced from data simulations. The interpretation of a composite should be made alongside results from the individual components. The average \emph{z} score offers the most power, but this should be considered in the research context and is not without its limitations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

For example, a global rank composite is typically analyzed using a MannâWhitney U test, and the results are summarized by the mean of ranks and a corresponding P value. The mean of ranks is uninformative, and a clinically meaningful estimate of the treatment effect is needed to communicate study results and facilitate an assessment of heterogeneity (the consistency of the effect across outcomes). The probability index is intuitive for clinicians, easy to calculate, and may be applied to various composites. We suggest a simple and familiar plot to assess heterogeneity across outcomes, which should be routine when analyzing composites. We think that the probability index provides an immediate and simple solution to an overt problem.},

However, the VITAMINS trial in patients with septic shock adopted a composite of mortality and vasopressor-free days, and an ordinal scale describing patient status rapidly became standard in COVID studies. Aware that recent use could incite interest in such endpoints, we are motivated to flag their potential value and pitfalls for sepsis research and COVID studies.},

Mean (SE) probability estimates of students in the concept group were statistically significantly closer to calculated bayesian probability than the other 2 groups (concept, 0.4\%; [0.7\%]; experience, 3.5\% [0.7\%]; control, 4.3\% [0.7\%];\emph{P} \&lt; .001).

  abstract = {Rank-based inference methods are applied in various disciplines, typically when procedures relying on standard normal theory are not justifiable. Various specific rank-based methods have been developed for two and more samples and also for general factorial designs (e.g. KruskalâWallis test or AkritasâArnoldâBrunner test). It is the aim of the present paper (1) to demonstrate that traditional rank procedures for several samples or general factorial designs may lead to surprising results in case of unequal sample sizes as compared with equal sample sizes, (2) to explain why this is the case and (3) to provide a way to overcome these disadvantages. Theoretical investigations show that the surprising results can be explained by considering the non-centralities of the test statistics, which may be non-zero for the usual rank-based procedures in case of unequal sample sizes, while they may be equal to 0 in case of equal sample sizes. A simple solution is to consider unweighted relative effects instead of weighted relative effects. The former effects are estimated by means of the so-called pseudo-ranks, while the usual ranks naturally lead to the latter effects. A real data example illustrates the practical meaning of the theoretical discussions.},

Even keen proponents of the use of AIC in model selection such as Burnham \& Anderson (2002), Model Selection and Multi-model Inference: A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, recommend selecting the model with lowest AIC from among a few, theoretically well-founded, candidate models, \& inveigh against data dredging.

This practice can lead to distorted effect size estimates, inflated error rates, and other problems. We argue for the application of ordinal models that make appropriate assumptions about the variables under study. In this tutorial article, we first explain the three major ordinal model classes; the cumulative, sequential and adjacent category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on stem cell opinions and marriage time courses. Appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models. Ordinal models provide better theoretical interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we recommend their widespread adoption in Psychology.},

  abstract = {We introduce a general, flexible, parametric survival modelling framework which encompasses key shapes of hazard functions (constant; increasing; decreasing; up then down; down then up) and various common survival distributions (log-logistic; Burr type XII; Weibull; Gompertz) and includes defective distributions (cure models). This generality is achieved by using four distributional parameters: two scale-type parametersâone of which relates to accelerated failure time (AFT) modelling; the other to proportional hazards (PH) modellingâand two shape parameters. Furthermore, we advocate âmultiparameter regressionâ whereby more than one distributional parameter depends on covariatesârather than the usual convention of having a single covariate-dependent (scale) parameter. This general formulation unifies the most popular survival models, enabling us to consider the practical value of possible modelling choices. In particular, we suggest introducing covariates through just one or other of the two scale parameters (covering AFT and PH models), and through a âpowerâ shape parameter (covering more complex non-AFT or non-PH effects); the other shape parameter remains covariate independent and handles automatic selection of the baseline distribution. We explore inferential issues and compare with alternative models through various simulation studies, with particular focus on evidence concerning the need, or otherwise, to include both AFT and PH parameters. We illustrate the efficacy of our modelling framework by using data from lung cancer, melanoma and kidney function studies. Censoring is accommodated throughout.},

Its use has been hampered by the difficulty in solving the estimating equations for the model's coefficients. In recent years, however, important developments have taken place regarding the methods of solving the equations. In this article, we briefly review the developments, focusing mainly on rank-based estimation. We conduct a simulation study that directly focuses on the applicability of the model in the context of (cancer) clinical trials. We also investigate the robustness of the AFT model to the omission of covariates. Finally, we conduct a meta-analysis of multiple clinical trials in gastric cancer to illustrate the benefits of the use of the model in practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The TNM staging system originated as a response to the need for an accurate, consistent, universal cancer outcome prediction system. Since the TNM staging system was introduced in the 1950s, new prognostic factors have been identified and new methods for integrating prognostic factors have been developed. This study compares the prediction accuracy of the TNM staging system with that of artificial neural network statistical models. METHODS: For 5-year survival of patients with breast or colorectal carcinoma, the authors compared the TNM staging system's predictive accuracy with that of artificial neural networks (ANN). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, as applied to an independent validation data set, was the measure of accuracy. RESULTS: For the American College of Surgeons' Patient Care Evaluation (PCE) data set, using only the TNM variables (tumor size, number of positive regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis), the artificial neural network's predictions of the 5-year survival of patients with breast carcinoma were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.720; ANN, 0.770; P {$<$} 0.001). For the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results breast carcinoma data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of 10-year survival were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.692; ANN, 0.730; P {$<$} 0.01). For the PCE colorectal data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of the 5-year survival of patients with colorectal carcinoma were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.737; ANN, 0.815; P {$<$} 0.001). Adding commonly collected demographic and anatomic variables to the TNM variables further increased the accuracy of the artificial neural network's predictions of breast carcinoma survival (0.784) and colorectal carcinoma survival (0.869). CONCLUSIONS: Artificial neural networks are significantly more accurate than the TNM staging system when both use the TNM prognostic factors alone. New prognostic factors can be added to artificial neural networks to increase prognostic accuracy further. These results are robust across different data sets and cancer sites.},

The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which the Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. This study investigates practical consequences of this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data mechanisms. Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models. The results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. Of particular interest is that these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from observed marginal distributions. It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual performance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and therefore deserves further study.},

This failure in translation has led investigators to speculate that the animal models being used do not predict therapeutic responses in humans. Although this issue continues to be debated, an important concern that has not been addressed is whether improvements in preclinical study design can be identified that might also increase the likelihood of translating basic AKI research into clinical practice using the current models. In this review, we have taken an evidence-based approach to identify common weaknesses in study design and reporting in preclinical AKI research that may contribute to the poor translatability of the findings. We focused on use of N-acetylcysteine or sodium bicarbonate for the prevention of contrast-induced AKI and use of erythropoietin for the prevention of AKI, two therapeutic approaches that have been extensively studied in clinical trials. On the basis of our findings, we identified five areas for improvement in preclinical study design and reporting. These suggested and preliminary guidelines may help improve the quality of preclinical research for AKI drug development. Copyright  2015 by the American Society of Nephrology.},

  abstract = {Diagnostic problems in medicine are sometimes polytomous, meaning that the outcome has more than two distinct categories. For example, ovarian tumors can be benign, borderline, primary invasive, or metastatic. Extending the main measure of binary discrimination, the c-statistic or area under the ROC curve, to nominal polytomous settings is not straightforward. This paper reviews existing measures and presents the polytomous discrimination index (PDI) as an alternative. The PDI assesses all sets of k cases consisting of one case from each outcome category. For each category i (i\,=\,1,\,...\,,k), it is assessed whether the risk of category i is highest for the case from category i. A score of 1âk is given per category for which this holds, yielding a set score between 0 and 1 to indicate the level of discrimination. The PDI is the average set score and is interpreted as the probability to correctly identify a case from a randomly selected category within a set of k cases. This probability can be split up by outcome category, yielding k category-specific values that result in the PDI when averaged. We demonstrate the measures on two diagnostic problems (residual mass histology after chemotherapy for testicular cancer; diagnosis of ovarian tumors). We compare the behavior of the measures on theoretical data, showing that PDI is more strongly influenced by simultaneous discrimination between all categories than by partial discrimination between pairs of categories. In conclusion, the PDI is attractive because it better matches the requirements of a measure to summarize polytomous discrimination.},

  abstract = {Decision-analytic measures to assess clinical utility of prediction models and diagnostic tests incorporate the relative clinical consequences of true and false positives without the need for external information such as monetary costs. Net Benefit is a commonly used metric that weights the relative consequences in terms of the risk threshold at which a patient would opt for treatment. Theoretical results demonstrate that clinical utility is affected by a model';s calibration, the extent to which estimated risks correspond to observed event rates. We analyzed the effects of different types of miscalibration on Net Benefit and investigated whether and under what circumstances miscalibration can make a model clinically harmful. Clinical harm is defined as a lower Net Benefit compared with classifying all patients as positive or negative by default. We used simulated data to investigate the effect of overestimation, underestimation, overfitting (estimated risks too extreme), and underfitting (estimated risks too close to baseline risk) on Net Benefit for different choices of the risk threshold. In accordance with theory, we observed that miscalibration always reduced Net Benefit. Harm was sometimes observed when models underestimated risk at a threshold below the event rate (as in underestimation and overfitting) or overestimated risk at a threshold above event rate (as in overestimation and overfitting). Underfitting never resulted in a harmful model. The impact of miscalibration decreased with increasing discrimination. Net Benefit was less sensitive to miscalibration for risk thresholds close to the event rate than for other thresholds. We illustrate these findings with examples from the literature and with a case study on testicular cancer diagnosis. Our findings strengthen the importance of obtaining calibrated risk models.

The overall quality of medical research remains poor, despite longstanding criticisms. The problems are well known, but the research community fails to properly address them. We suggest most problems stem from an underlying paradox: although methodology is undeniably the backbone of qualitative and responsible research, science consistently undervalues methodology. The focus remains more on the destination (research claims and metrics) than on the journey. Notwithstanding, research should serve society more than the reputation of those involved. While we notice that many initiatives are being established to improve components of the research cycle, these initiatives are too disjointed. The overall system is monolithic and slow to adapt. We assert that a top-down action is needed from journals, universities, funders and governments to break the cycle and put methodology first. These actions should involve the widespread adoption of registered reports, balanced research funding between innovative, incremental and methodological research projects, full recognition and demystification of peer review, mandatory statistical review of reports, adherence to reporting guidelines, and investment in methodological education and research. Currently, the scientific enterprise is doing a major disservice to patients and society.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The mid-P Fisher-Irwin test by doubling the one-sided probability performs better than standard versions of the Fisher-Irwin test, and the mid-P method by Irwin's rule performs better still in having actual type I errors closer to nominal levels."; strong support for the 'N-1' test provided expected frequencies exceed 1;flaw in Fisher test which was based on Fisher's premise that marginal totals carry no useful information;demonstration of their useful information in very small sample sizes;Yate's continuity adjustment of N/2 is a large over correction and is inappropriate;counter arguments exist to the use of randomization tests in randomized trials;calculations of worst cases;overall recommendation: use the 'N-1' chi-square test when all expected frequencies are at least 1, otherwise use the Fisher-Irwin test using Irwin's rule for two-sided tests, taking tables from either tail as likely, or less, as that observed; see letter to the editor by Antonio Andres and author's reply in 27:1791-1796; 2008.}

Recent findings: While currently under-utilized in epidemiologic research, the difference-in-difference method is a useful tool to examine effects of population-level exposures, but relies on strong assumptions. Summary: We use the famous example of John Snow's investigation of the cause of cholera mortality in London to illustrate the difference-in-difference approach and corresponding assumptions. We conclude by arguing that this method deserves a second-look from epidemiologists interested in asking causal questions about the impact of a population-level exposure change on a population-level outcome for the group that experienced the change.},

  abstract = {Ordinal data appear in a wide variety of scientific fields. These data are often analyzed using ordinal logistic regression models that assume proportional odds. When this assumption is not met, it may be possible to capture the lack of proportionality using a constrained structural relationship between the odds and the cut-points of the ordinal values. We consider a trend odds version of this constrained model, wherein the odds parameter increases or decreases in a monotonic manner across the cut-points. We demonstrate algebraically and graphically how this model is related to latent logistic, normal, and exponential distributions. In particular, we find that scale changes in these potential latent distributions are consistent with the trend odds assumption, with the logistic and exponential distributions having odds that increase in a linear or nearly linear fashion. We show how to fit this model using SAS Proc NLMIXED and perform simulations under proportional odds and trend odds processes. We find that the added complexity of the trend odds model gives improved power over the proportional odds model when there are moderate to severe departures from proportionality. A hypothetical data set is used to illustrate the interpretation of the trend odds model, and we apply this model to a swine influenza example wherein the proportional odds assumption appears to be violated.

  abstract = {PURPOSESomatostatin analogs (SSAs) are recommended for the first-line treatment of most patients with well-differentiated, gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors; however, benefit from treatment is heterogeneous. The aim of the current study was to develop and validate a progression-free survival (PFS) prediction model in SSA-treated patients.PATIENTS AND METHODSWe extracted data from the Spanish Group of Neuroendocrine and Endocrine Tumors Registry (R-GETNE). Patient eligibility criteria included GEP primary, Ki-67 of 20\% or less, and first-line SSA monotherapy for advanced disease. An accelerated failure time model was developed to predict PFS, which was represented as a nomogram and an online calculator. The nomogram was externally validated in an independent series of consecutive eligible patients (The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom).RESULTSWe recruited 535 patients (R-GETNE, n = 438; Manchester, n = 97). Median PFS and overall survival in the derivation cohort were 28.7 (95\% CI, 23.8 to 31.1) and 85.9 months (95\% CI, 71.5 to 96.7 months), respectively. Nine covariates significantly associated with PFS were primary tumor location, Ki-67 percentage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, alkaline phosphatase, extent of liver involvement, presence of bone and peritoneal metastases, documented progression status, and the presence of symptoms when initiating SSA. The GETNE-TRASGU (Treated With Analog of Somatostatin in Gastroenteropancreatic and Unknown Primary NETs) model demonstrated suitable calibration, as well as fair discrimination ability with a C-index value of 0.714 (95\% CI, 0.680 to 0.747) and 0.732 (95\% CI, 0.658 to 0.806) in the derivation and validation series, respectively.CONCLUSIONThe GETNE-TRASGU evidence-based prognostic tool stratifies patients with GEP neuroendocrine tumors receiving SSA treatment according to their estimated PFS. This nomogram may be useful when stratifying patients with neuroendocrine tumors in future trials. Furthermore, it could be a valuable tool for making treatment decisions in daily clinical practice.},

This article seeks to address both applied practitioners and researchers interested in a more formal explanation of some of the results. For practitioners, the framework, illustrative examples and code should equip them with a practical approach to address the issues raised by missing data (particularly using multiple imputation), alongside an overview of how the various approaches in the literature relate. In particular, we describe how multiple imputation can be readily used for sensitivity analyses, which are still infrequently performed. For those interested in more formal derivations, we give outline arguments for key results, use simple examples to show how methods relate, and references for full details. The ideas are illustrated with a cohort study, a multi-centre case control study and a randomised clinical trial.},

This document provides the rationale and background for the trial and highlights key design features. We discuss five novel challenges to the design and conduct of a large, multicenter, randomized trial during a pandemic, including 1) widespread, off-label use of the study drug before the availability of safety and efficacy data; 2) the need to adapt traditional procedures for documentation of informed consent during an infectious pandemic; 3) developing a flexible and robust Bayesian analysis incorporating significant uncertainty about the disease, outcomes, and treatment; 4) obtaining indistinguishable drug and placebo without delaying enrollment; and 5) rapidly obtaining administrative and regulatory approvals. Our goals in describing how the ORCHID trial progressed from study conception to enrollment of the first patient in 15 days are to inform the development of other high-quality, multicenter trials targeting COVID-19. We describe lessons learned to improve the efficiency of future clinical trials, particularly in the setting of pandemics. The ORCHID trial will provide high-quality, clinically relevant data on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04332991).},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to use Monte Carlo simulations to compare logistic regression with propensity scores in terms of bias, precision, empirical coverage probability, empirical power, and robustness when the number of events is low relative to the number of confounders. The authors simulated a cohort study and performed 252,480 trials. In the logistic regression, the bias decreased as the number of events per confounder increased. In the propensity score, the bias decreased as the strength of the association of the exposure with the outcome increased. Propensity scores produced estimates that were less biased, more robust, and more precise than the logistic regression estimates when there were seven or fewer events per confounder. The logistic regression empirical coverage probability increased as the number of events per confounder increased. The propensity score empirical coverage probability decreased after eight or more events per confounder. Overall, the propensity score exhibited more empirical power than logistic regression. Propensity scores are a good alternative to control for imbalances when there are seven or fewer events per confounder; however, empirical power could range from 35\% to 60\%. Logistic regression is the technique of choice when there are at least eight events per confounder.},

  abstract = {When estimating the treatment effect in a randomized controlled trial, it is common to have a continuous outcome which is also observed at baseline. These observations are often prone to measurement error, for example due to within-patient variability. Controversy exists in the literature about whether baseline measurement error should be adjusted for in this context. Computer simulations were used to compare the biases in the estimated treatment effect, with and without adjusting for measurement error, and for different levels of observed baseline imbalance. The impacts of sample size (30 per group and 300 per group) and reliability coefficient (0.6, 0.8 and 1) were also assessed. The results show that in randomized controlled trials, the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator without adjusting for measurement error is unbiased. On the contrary, adjusting for measurement error leads to bias, especially when sample sizes are small and/or measurement error is large. The treatment effect adjusting for measurement error is on average overestimated when the baseline mean of the control group is larger than that of the treated group. It is underestimated when the control group has a smaller baseline mean.},

  abstract = {Individual or stand-level biomass is not easy to measure. The current methods employed, based on cutting down a representative sample of plantations, make it possible to assess the biomasses for various compartments (bark, dead branches, leaves, â¦). However, this felling makes individual longitudinal follow-up impossible. In this context, we propose a method to evaluate individual biomasses by compartments when these are ordinals. Biomass is measured visually and observations are therefore not destructive. The technique is based on a probit model redefined in terms of latent variables. A generalization of the univariate case to the multivariate case is then natural and takes into account of dependency between compartment biomasses. These models are then extended to the longitudinal case by developing a Dynamic Multivariate Ordinal Probit Model. The performance of the MCMC algorithm used for the estimation is illustrated by means of simulations built from known biomass models. The quality of the estimates and the impact of certain parameters, are then discussed.},

A popular bootstrap method for such data is the parametric bootstrap based on the same random effects model as that used in inference. However, it is hard to justify this type of bootstrap when this model is known to be an approximation. In this article, we describe a random effect block bootstrap approach for clustered data that is simple to implement, free of both the distribution and the dependence assumptions of the parametric bootstrap, and is consistent when the mixed model assumptions are valid. Results based on Monte Carlo simulation show that the proposed method seems robust to failure of the dependence assumptions of the assumed mixed model. An application to a realistic environmental dataset indicates that the method produces sensible results.

  abstract = {Bioequivalence trials are commonly conducted to assess therapeutic equivalence between a generic and an innovator brand formulations. In such trials, drug concentrations are obtained repeatedly over time and are summarized using a metric such as the area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC) for each subject. The usual practice is to then conduct two one-sided tests using these areas to evaluate for average bioequivalence. A major disadvantage of this approach is the loss of information encountered when ignoring the correlation structure between repeated measurements in the computation of areas. In this article, we propose a general linear model approach that incorporates the within-subject covariance structure for making inferences on mean areas. The model-based method can be seen to arise naturally from the reparameterization of the AUC as a linear combination of outcome means. We investigate and compare the inferential properties of our proposed method with the traditional two one-sided tests approach using Monte Carlo simulation studies. We also examine the properties of the method in the event of missing data. Simulations show that the proposed approach is a cost-effective, viable alternative to the traditional method with superior inferential properties. Inferential advantages are particularly apparent in the presence of missing data. To illustrate our approach, a real working example from an asthma study is utilized.},

Many models have been developed to analyze these kind of data: the Andersen-Gill's model is one of them as well as the Prentice-William and the Peterson's model, the Wei Lee and Weissfeld's model, or even frailty models, all assuming an independent and noninformative censoring. However, in practice, these assumptions may be violated by the existence of a terminal event that permanently stops the recurrent process (eg, death). Indeed, a patient who experiences an early terminal event is more likely to have a lower number of recurrent events than a patient who experiences a terminal event later. Thus, ignoring terminal events in the analysis may lead to biased results. Many methods have been developed to handle terminal events. In this paper, we describe the existing methods classifying into conditional or marginal methods and compare them in a simulation study to highlight bias in results if an inappropriate method is used, when recurrent events and terminal event are correlated. In addition, we apply the different models on a real dataset to show how results should be interpreted. Finally, we provide recommendations for choosing the appropriate method for analyzing recurrent events in the presence of a terminal event.},

By formulating an interim decision rule for removing one of the treatments, we use a Bayesian model and the resulting posterior distributions to provide sufficient evidence that one treatment is inferior to the other treatments before enrolling more participants. By doing so, we can remove the worst performing treatment at an interim analysis and prevent the subsequent participants from receiving the removed treatment. On the basis of simulation results, we have evidence that the treatment response rates can still be unbiasedly and efficiently estimated in our new design, especially for the treatments with higher response rates. In addition, by adjusting the decision rule criteria for the posterior probabilities, we can control the probability of incorrectly removing an effective treatment.},

However, although statisticians may admit this privately (Breiman (1992) calls it a `quiet scandal'), they (we) continue to ignore the difficulties because it is not clear what else could or should be done. P. 421: Estimation errors for regression coefficients are usually smaller than errors from failing to take into account model specification. P. 422: Statisticians must stop pretending that model uncertainty does not exist and begin to find ways of coping with it. P. 426: It is indeed strange that we often admit model uncertainty by searching for a best model but then ignore this uncertainty by making inferences and predictions as if certain that the best fitting model is actually true. P. 427: The analyst needs to assess the model selection~ process and not just the best fitting model. P. 432: The use of subset selection methods is well known to introduce alarming biases. P. 433: ... the AIC can be highly biased in data-driven model selection situations. P. 434: Prediction intervals will generally be too narrow. In the discussion, Jamal R. M.

  abstract = {Markov models used to analyze transition patterns in discrete longitudinal data are based on the limiting assumption that individuals follow the common underlying transition process. However, when one is interested in diseases with different disease or severity subtypes, explicitly modeling subpopulation-specific transition patterns may be appropriate. We propose a model which captures heterogeneity in the transition process through a finite mixture model formulation and provides a framework for identifying subpopulations at different risks. We apply the procedure to longitudinal bacterial vaginosis study data and demonstrate that the model fits the data well. Further, we show that under the mixture model formulation, we can make the important distinction between how covariates affect transition patterns unique to each of the subpopulations and how they affect which subgroup a participant will belong to. Practically, covariate effects on subpopulation-specific transition behavior and those on subpopulation membership can be interpreted as effects on short-term and long-term transition behavior. We further investigate models with higher-order subpopulation-specific transition dependence.},

To examine the performance of and relationships between these three methods in this setting, we derive and investigate small sample and asymptotic expressions of the estimates and standard errors, and fully examine how these estimates are related for the three approaches in the linear regression model when the responses are MAR. We show that when the responses are MAR in the linear model, the estimates of the regression coefficients using these three methods are asymptotically equivalent to the complete case estimates under general conditions. One simulation and a real data set from a liver cancer clinical trial are given to compare the properties of these methods when the responses are MAR.},

The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model, however, is frequently violated in practice and many alternative models have been proposed in the statistical literature. Unfortunately, the regression coefficients obtained from different models are often not directly comparable. To overcome this problem, we propose a family of weighted hazard ratio measures that are based on the marginal survival curves or marginal hazard functions, and can be estimated using readily available output from various modeling approaches. The proposed transformation family includes the transformations considered by Schemper et al. (Statist Med 28:2473-2489, 2009) as special cases. In addition, we propose a novel estimate of the weighted hazard ratio based on the maximum departure from the null hypothesis within the transformation family, and develop a Kolmogorov[Formula: see text]Smirnov type of test statistic based on this estimate. Simulation studies show that when the hazard functions of two groups either converge or diverge, this new estimate yields a more powerful test than tests based on the individual transformations recommended in Schemper et al. (Statist Med 28:2473-2489, 2009), with a similar magnitude of power loss when the hazards cross. The proposed estimates and test statistics are applied to a colorectal cancer clinical trial.},

Our prioritized concordance index measures the probability that, given a random subject pair, the subject with the worst disease status as of a time Ï has the higher predicted risk. Our prioritized concordance index uses the same approach as the win ratio, by basing generalized pairwise comparisons on the most severe or clinically important comparable outcome. We use an inverse probability weighting technique to correct for study-specific censoring. Asymptotic properties are derived using U-statistic properties. We apply the prioritized concordance index to two types of disease processes with a rare primary outcome and a more common secondary outcome. Our simulation studies show that when a predictor is predictive of both outcomes, the new concordance index can gain efficiency and power in identifying true prognostic variables compared to using the primary outcome alone. Using the prioritized concordance index, we examine whether novel clinical measures can be useful in predicting risk of type II diabetes in patients with impaired glucose resistance whose disease status can also regress to normal glucose resistance. We also examine the discrimination ability of four published risk models among ever smokers at risk of lung cancer incidence and subsequent death.},

However, existing methods for semiparametric longitudinal binary regression modeling (i) mainly concern mean structures with association parameters treated as nuisance; (ii) generally require a correct specification of the covariance structure for misspecified covariance structure may lead to inefficient mean parameter estimates; and (iii) usually run into computation and estimation problems when the time points are irregularly and possibly subject specific. In this article, we propose a semiparametric logistic regression model, which simultaneously takes into account both the mean and response-association structures (via conditional log-odds ratio) for multivariate longitudinal binary outcomes. Our main interest lies in efficient estimation of both the marginal and association parameters. The estimators of the parameters are obtained via the profile kernel approach. We evaluate the proposed methodology through simulation studies and apply it to a real dataset. Both theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method yields highly efficient estimators and performs satisfactorily.},

  abstract = {Measures of predictive ability play an important role in quantifying the clinical significance of prognostic factors. Several measures have been proposed to evaluate the predictive ability of survival models in the last two decades, but no single measure is consistently used. The proposed measures can be classified into the following categories: explained variation, explained randomness, and predictive accuracy. The three categories are conceptually different and are based on different principles. Several new measures have been proposed since Schemper and Stare's study in 1996 on some of the existing measures. This paper is the first of two papers that study the proposed measures systematically by applying a set of criteria that a measure of predictive ability should possess in the context of survival analysis. The present paper focuses on the explained variation category, and part II studies the proposed measures in the other categories. Simulation studies are used to examine the performance of five explained variation measures with respect to these criteria, discussing their strengths and shortcomings. Our simulation studies show that the measures proposed by Kent and O'Quigley, RÂ²\_PM, and Royston and Sauerbrei, RÂ²\_D, appear to be the best overall at quantifying predictive ability. However, it should be noted that neither measure is perfect; RÂ²\_PM is sensitive to outliers and RÂ²\_d to (marked) non-normality of the distribution of the prognostic index. The results show that the other measures perform poorly, primarily because they are adversely affected by censoring.},

In this paper, we study the remaining measures in a similar fashion, discussing their strengths and shortcomings. Simulation studies are used to examine the performance of the measures with respect to the criteria we set out in Part I. Our simulation studies showed that among the measures studied in this paper, the measures proposed by Kent and O'Quigley ÏÂ²\_W (and its approximation ÏÂ²\_W,A and Schemper and Kaider RÂ²\_SK perform better with respect to our criteria. However, our investigations showed that ÏÂ²\_W is adversely affected by the distribution of covariate and the presence of influential observations. The results show that the other measures perform poorly, primarily because they are affected either by the degree of censoring or the follow-up period.},

  abstract = {We propose a joint model for longitudinal and survival data with time-varying covariates subject to detection limits and intermittent missingness at random. The model is motivated by data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), in which HIV+ subjects have viral load and CD4 cell count measured at repeated visits along with survival data. We model the longitudinal component using a normal linear mixed model, modeling the trajectory of CD4 cell count by regressing on viral load, and other covariates. The viral load data are subject to both left censoring because of detection limits (17\%) and intermittent missingness (27\%). The survival component of the joint model is a Cox model with time-dependent covariates for death because of AIDS. The longitudinal and survival models are linked using the trajectory function of the linear mixed model. A Bayesian analysis is conducted on the MACS data using the proposed joint model. The proposed method is shown to improve the precision of estimates when compared with alternative methods. Copyright  2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {To many, the foundations of statistical inference are cryptic and irrelevant to routine statistical practice. The analysis of 2 x 2 contingency tables, omnipresent in the scientific literature, is a case in point. Fisher's exact test is routinely used even though it has been fraught with controversy for over 70 years. The problem, not widely acknowledged, is that several different p-values can be associated with a single table, making scientific inference inconsistent. The root cause of this controversy lies in the table's origins and the manner in which nuisance parameters are eliminated. However, fundamental statistical principles (e.g., sufficiency, ancillarity, conditionality, and likelihood) can shed light on the controversy and guide our approach in using this test. In this paper, we use these fundamental principles to show how much information is lost when the tables origins are ignored and when various approaches are used to eliminate unknown nuisance parameters. We present novel likelihood contours to aid in the visualization of information loss and show that the information loss is often virtually non-existent. We find that problems arising from the discreteness of the sample space are exacerbated by p-value-based inference. Accordingly, methods that are less sensitive to this discreteness - likelihood ratios, posterior probabilities and mid-p-values - lead to more consistent inferences.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comprehensive assessment of quality of care includes patient-reported outcomes, safety of care delivered, and patient satisfaction. The impact of the patient-reported Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores at baseline and 12 months on satisfaction with outcomes following spine surgery is not well documented. PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the impact of patient disability (ODI) scores at baseline and 12 months on satisfaction with outcomes following surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of prospectively collected longitudinal web-based multicenter data. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients undergoing elective surgery for degenerative lumbar disease were entered into a prospective multicenter registry. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were ODI, North American Spine Society satisfaction (NASS) questionnaire. METHODS: Baseline and 12-month ODI scores were recorded. Satisfaction at 12 months after surgery was measured using NASS questionnaire. Multivariable proportional odds logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the impact of baseline and 12-month ODI on satisfaction with outcomes. RESULTS: Of the total 5,443 patients, 64\% (n=3,460) were satisfied at a level where surgery met their expectations (NASS level 1) at 12 months after surgery. After adjusting for all baseline and surgery-specific variables, the 12-month ODI score had the highest impact (Wald Ï2=1,555, 86\% of the total Ï2) on achieving satisfaction with outcomes compared with baseline ODI scores (Wald Ï2=93, 5\% of the total Ï2). The level of satisfaction decreases with increasing 12-month ODI score. Greater change in ODI is required to achieve a better satisfaction level when the patient starts with a higher baseline ODI score. CONCLUSION: Absolute 12-month ODI following surgery had a significant association on satisfaction with outcomes 12 months after surgery. Patients with higher baseline ODI required a larger change in ODI score to achieve satisfaction. No single measure can be used as a sole yardstick to measure quality of care after spine surgery. Satisfaction may be used in conjunction with baseline and 12-month ODI scores to provide an assessment of the quality of spine surgery provided in a patient centric fashion.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prospective patient-reported outcomes (PROs) registries are central to emerging evidence-driven reform models. These registries entail significant operator and responder burden to capture PROs data. It is important to limit the number of PROs administered. We sought to determine whether the anxiety/depression domain of EQ-5D could be used to define preoperative psychological distress in patients undergoing elective spine surgery. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective spine surgery and enrolled into a prospective registry were analyzed. The 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey Mental Component Summary, Zung depression scale, Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire, and EQ-5D were completed. The anxiety/depression domain of EQ-5D was used to define psychological distress; responses were captured as 1) not anxious or depressed, 2) moderately anxious or depressed, or 3) extremely anxious or depressed. Univariate correlation and proportional odds logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Of 2470 included patients undergoing elective spine surgery, 45\% (n~= 1109) reported no psychological distress, 47\% (n~= 1168) reported moderate psychological distress, and 8\% (n~= 193) reported extreme psychological distress on EQ-5D. Psychological distress on EQ-5D had positive correlation with Zung depression scale (P {$<$} 0.0001, r~= 0.620) and Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire (P {$<$} 0.0001, r~= 0.450) and negative correlation with 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey Mental Component Summary (P {$<$} 0.0001, r~=~-0.662). In proportional odds logistic regression models, EQ-5D psychological distress had significant correlations with 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey Mental Component Summary (P {$<$} 0.0001, C-index~= 0.831), Zung depression scale (P {$<$} 0.0001, C-index~= 0.802), and Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire (P {$<$} 0.0001, C-index~= 0.711). CONCLUSIONS: The anxiety/depression domain of EQ-5D could be used to categorize preoperative psychological distress. Spine registries could use this information to potentially limit the number of validated PROs administered.},

Study design and setting: We conducted a Medline literature search (1/2016 to 8/2017), and extracted comparisons between LR and ML models for binary outcomes. Results: We included 71 out of 927 studies. The median sample size was 1250 (range 72-3,994,872), with 19 predictors considered (range 5-563) and 8 events per predictor (range 0.3-6,697). The most common ML methods were classification trees (30 studies), random forests (28), artificial neural networks (26), and support vector machines (24). Sixty-four (90\%) studies used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess discrimination. Calibration was not addressed in 56 (79\%) studies. We identified 282 comparisons between a LR and ML model (AUC range, 0.52-0.99). For 145 comparisons at low risk of bias, the difference in logit(AUC) between LR and ML was 0.00 (95\% confidence interval, -0.18 to 0.18). For 137 comparisons at high risk of bias, logit(AUC) was 0.34 (0.20 to 0.47) higher for ML. Conclusions: We found no evidence of superior performance of ML over LR for clinical prediction modeling, but improvements in methodology and reporting are needed for studies that compare modeling algorithms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

When data are skewed, the standard two-tailed t test is not appropriate and the permutation test comparing the two means (or medians) has been a widely recommended alternative, with statistical authors and statistical software packages touting the permutation testâs utility, particularly for small samples. In this presentation, we illustrate that when the two samples are skewed and the sample sizes are unequal, the two-tailed permutation test (as traditionally implemented) can in some cases have power equal to zero, even when the k highest values in the combined data are all found in the group with k observations. Further, in many cases the standard permutation test exhibits decreasing power as the total sample size increases! We illustrate the causes of these perverse properties via both simulation and real-world examples, and we recommend approaches for ameliorating or avoiding these potential problems.},

In particular, we introduce two novel sensitivity measures suited for routine reporting. The robustness value describes the minimum strength of association that unobserved confounding would need to have, both with the treatment and with the outcome, to change the research conclusions. The partial R2 of the treatment with the outcome shows how strongly confounders explaining all the residual outcome variation would have to be associated with the treatment to eliminate the estimated effect. Next, we offer graphical tools for elaborating on problematic confounders, examining the sensitivity of point estimates and t-values, as well as âextreme scenariosâ. Finally, we describe problems with a common âbenchmarkingâ practice and introduce a novel procedure to bound the strength of confounders formally on the basis of a comparison with observed covariates. We apply these methods to a running example that estimates the effect of exposure to violence on attitudes toward peace.},

  abstract = {Rigorous scientific review of research protocols is critical to making funding decisions, and to the protection of both human and non-human research participants. Given the increasing complexity of research designs and data analysis methods, quantitative experts, such as biostatisticians, play an essential role in evaluating the rigor and reproducibility of proposed methods. However, there is a common misconception that a statisticianâs input is relevant only to sample size/power and statistical analysis sections of a protocol. The comprehensive nature of a biostatistical review coupled with limited guidance on key components of protocol review motived this work. Members of the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design Special Interest Group of the Association for Clinical and Translational Science used a consensus approach to identify the elements of research protocols that a biostatistician should consider in a review, and provide specific guidance on how each element should be reviewed. We present the resulting review framework as an educational tool and guideline for biostatisticians navigating review boards and panels. We briefly describe the approach to developing the framework, and we provide a comprehensive checklist and guidance on review of each protocol element. We posit that the biostatistical reviewer, through their breadth of engagement across multiple disciplines and experience with a range of research designs, can and should contribute significantly beyond review of the statistical analysis plan and sample size justification. Through careful scientific review, we hope to prevent excess resource expenditure and risk to humans and animals on poorly planned studies.},

  note = {Karl Pearson produced the Biometrika tables in a format that allowed one to look up the P-value given the t value. In the post World War I British economy, Biometrika was in some financial trouble and they resorted to copyright protection of parts of their publications such as tables. To get around copyright protection, Ronald Fisher restructered the tables to present critical values for t for Î±=.01, .02, .05, .1, .2, .3, ... .9. This has led to the use of cutoffs for P-values to determine what Fisher called ``significance'', which has led to widespread problems in science and especially to publication bias. See the article by Stigler that follows this article, and its reference to the 1919 paper by Boring.}

  abstract = {To evaluate the totality of one treatment's benefit/risk profile relative to an alternative treatment via a longitudinal comparative clinical study, the timing and occurrence of multiple clinical events are typically collected during the patient's follow-up. These multiple observations reflect the patient's disease progression/burden over time. The standard practice is to create a composite endpoint from the multiple outcomes, the timing of the occurrence of the first clinical event, to evaluate the treatment via the standard survival analysis techniques. By ignoring all events after the composite outcome, this type of assessment may not be ideal. Various parametric or semiparametric procedures have been extensively discussed in the literature for the purposes of analyzing multiple event-time data. Many existing methods were developed based on extensive model assumptions. When the model assumptions are not plausible, the resulting inferences for the treatment effect may be misleading. In this article, we propose a simple, nonparametric inference procedure to quantify the treatment effect, which has an intuitive clinically meaningful interpretation. We use the data from a cardiovascular clinical trial for heart failure to illustrate the procedure. A simulation study is also conducted to evaluate the performance of the new proposal.},

  abstract = {Although resistance to the P2Y12 antagonist clopidogrel is linked to altered drug metabolism, some studies suggest that these pharmacokinetic abnormalities only partially account for drug resistance. To circumvent pharmacokinetic complications and target P2Y12 receptor function we applied the direct P2Y12 antagonist 2-methylthio-AMP (2-methylthioadenosine 5'-monophosphate triethylammonium salt) to purified platelets ex vivo. Platelets were purified from healthy and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and stimulated with thrombin or the selective protease-activated receptor agonists, protease-activated receptor 1-activating peptide (PAR1-AP), or PAR4-AP. Platelet activation as measured by Î±IIbÎ²3 activation, and P-selectin expression was monitored in 141 subjects. Our results demonstrate that, compared with healthy subjects, platelets from diabetic patients are resistant to inhibition by 2-methylthio-AMP, demonstrating P2Y12 pharmacodynamic defects among diabetic patients. Inhibition of thrombin-mediated Î±IIbÎ²3 activation by 2-methylthio-AMP was lower in diabetic platelets versus healthy platelets. Subgroup analysis revealed a racial difference in the resistance to 2-methylthio-AMP. We found no resistance in platelets from diabetic African Americans; they were inhibited by 2-methylthio-AMP equally as well as platelets from healthy African Americans. In contrast, platelets from Caucasian patients with diabetes were resistant to P2Y12 antagonism compared with healthy Caucasians. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that other variables, such as obesity, age, or gender, could not account for the differential resistance to 2-methylthio-AMP among races. These results suggest that in addition to altered drug metabolism, P2Y12 receptor function itself is altered in the Caucasian diabetic population. The racial difference in platelet function in T2DM is a novel finding, which may lead to differences in treatment as well as new targets for antiplatelet therapy.},

This study sought to accomplish that goal. The nearly 1 million annual ED visits for AHF are associated with high proportions of admissions and consume significant resources. We prospectively enrolled 1,033 patients diagnosed with AHF in the ED from 4 hospitals between July 20, 2007, and February 4, 2011. We used an ordinal outcome hierarchy, defined as the incidence of the most severe adverse event within 30 days of ED evaluation (acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularization, emergent dialysis, intubation, mechanical cardiac support, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and death). Of 1,033 patients enrolled, 126 (12\%) experienced at least one 30-day adverse event. The decision tool had a C statistic of 0.68 (95\% confidence interval: 0.63 to 0.74). Elevated troponin (p~{$<$} 0.001) and renal function (p~= 0.01) were significant predictors of adverse events in our multivariable model, whereas B-type natriuretic peptide (p~= 0.09), tachypnea (p~= 0.09), and patients undergoing dialysis (p~= 0.07) trended toward significance. At risk thresholds of 1\%, 3\%, and 5\%, we found 0\%, 1.4\%, and 13.0\% patients were at low risk, with negative predictive values of 100\%, 96\%, and 93\%, respectively. The STRATIFY decision tool identifies ED patients with AHF who are at low risk for 30-day adverse events and may be candidates for safe ED discharge. After external testing, and perhaps when used as part of a shared decision-making strategy, it may significantly affect disposition strategies.

However, researchers are increasingly evaluating functional outcomes, such as quality of life. Importantly, in such trials some patients may die before the assessment of a functional outcome, resulting in the functional outcome being âtruncated due to death.â As described in this paper, defining and testing treatment effects on functional outcomes in this setting requires careful consideration. Data from a completed trial of critically ill patients are used to highlight key differences among three statistical approaches used when analyzing such trials.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {There are sometimes cost, scientific, or logistical reasons to allocate individuals unequally in an individually randomized trial. In cluster randomized trials we can allocate clusters unequally and/or allow different cluster size between trial arms. We consider parallel group designs with a continuous outcome, and optimal designs that require the smallest number of individuals to be measured given the number of clusters. Previous authors have derived the optimal allocation ratio for clusters under different variance and/or intracluster correlations (ICCs) between arms, allowing different but prespecified cluster sizes by arm. We derive closed-form expressions to identify the optimal proportions of clusters and of individuals measured for each arm, thereby defining optimal cluster sizes, when cluster size can be chosen freely. When ICCs differ between arms but the variance is equal, the optimal design allocates more than half the clusters to the arm with the higher ICC, but (typically only slightly) less than half the individuals and hence a smaller cluster size. We also describe optimal design under constraints on the number of clusters or cluster size in one or both arms. This methodology allows trialists to consider a range for the number of clusters in the trial and for each to identify the optimal design. Except if there is clear prior evidence for the ICC and variance by arm, a range of values will need to be considered. Researchers should choose a design with adequate power across the range, while also keeping enough clusters in each arm to permit the intended analysis method.},

  abstract = {In the statistical literature, a number of methods have been proposed to ensure valid inference about marginal effects of variables on a longitudinal outcome in settings with irregular monitoring times. However, the potential biases due to covariate-driven monitoring times and confounding have rarely been considered simultaneously, and never in a setting with an ordinal outcome and a continuous exposure. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a methodology for causal inference in such a setting, relying on a proportional odds model to study the effect of the exposure on the outcome. Irregular observation times are considered via a proportional rate model, and a generalization of inverse probability of treatment weights is used to account for the continuous exposure. We motivate our methodology by the estimation of the marginal (causal) effect of the time spent on video or computer games on suicide attempts in the Add Health study, a longitudinal study in the United States. Although in the Add Health data, observation times are prespecified, our proposed approach is applicable even in more general settings such as when analyzing data from electronic health records where observations are highly irregular. In simulation studies, we let observation times vary across individuals and demonstrate that not accounting for biasing imbalances due to the monitoring and the exposure schemes can bias the estimate for the marginal odds ratio of exposure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, reduces cardiovascular death and worsening heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Early initiation during an acute heart failure (AHF) hospitalization may facilitate decongestion, improve natriuresis, and facilitate safe transition to a beneficial outpatient therapy for both diabetes and heart failure. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of initiating dapagliflozin within the first 24 hours of hospitalization in patients with AHF compared to usual care. METHODS: DICTATE-AHF is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial enrolling a planned 240 patients in the United States. Patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalized with hypervolemic AHF and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL/min/1.73m2 are eligible for participation. Patients are randomly assigned 1:1 to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or structured usual care until day 5 or hospital discharge. Both treatment arms receive protocolized diuretic and insulin therapies. The primary endpoint is diuretic response expressed as the cumulative change in weight per cumulative loop diuretic dose in 40 mg intravenous furosemide equivalents. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include inpatient worsening AHF, 30-day hospital readmission for AHF or diabetic reasons, change in NT-proBNP, and measures of natriuresis. Safety endpoints include the incidence of hyper/hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, worsening kidney function, hypovolemic hypotension, and inpatient mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The DICTATE-AHF trial will establish the efficacy and safety of early initiation of dapagliflozin during AHF across both AHF and diabetic outcomes in patients with diabetes.},

It is often desirable that chosen simulation scenarios accurately reflect a biologically plausible underlying distribution. This is particularly important in the framework of survival analysis, where simulated distributions are chosen for both the event time and the censoring time. This paper develops methods for using complex distributions when generating survival times to assess methods in practice. We describe a general algorithm involving numerical integration and root-finding techniques to generate survival times from a variety of complex parametric distributions, incorporating any combination of time-dependent effects, time-varying covariates, delayed entry, random effects and covariates measured with error. User-friendly Stata software is provided.},

This lack of overlap can lead to imprecise estimates, and can make commonly used estimators sensitive to the choice of specification. In such cases researchers have often used ad hoc methods for trimming the sample. We develop a systematic approach to addressing lack of overlap. We characterize optimal subsamples for which the average treatment effect can be estimated most precisely. Under some conditions, the optimal selection rules depend solely on the propensity score. For a wide range of distributions, a good approximation to the optimal rule is provided by the simple rule of thumb to discard all units with estimated propensity scores outside the range [0.1,0.9].},

This work investigates the efficiency of adaptive sample size designs as compared to group sequential designs. We show that given a group sequential design, a uniformly more efficient adaptive sample size design based on the same maximum sample size and rejection boundary can be constructed. While maintaining stable statistical power at the required level, the expected sample size of the obtained adaptive sample size design is uniformly smaller than that of the group sequential design with respect to a range of the true treatment difference. The finding provides further insights into the efficiency of adaptive sample size designs and challenges the popular belief of better efficiency associated with group sequential designs. Good adaptive performance plus easy implementation and other desirable operational features make adaptive sample size designs more attractive and applicable to modern clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Prevention of decompensation is a primary therapeutic target in patients with compensated cirrhosis. However, a major problem is the large sample size and long follow-up required to demonstrate a significant treatment effect because of the relatively low baseline risk. For this reason, it has been recently suggested that ordinal outcomes may be used in this area to gain power and to reduce sample size. The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of ordinal outcomes in cirrhosis. An inception cohort of 202 patients with compensated cirrhosis (no ascites, gastrointestinal bleeding, encephalopathy, or jaundice) without esophageal varices was included, and 5-year outcome is reported. Etiology was mostly viral and alcoholic, and there were no dropouts. The ordinal outcome was set according to six grades with a previously established prognostic ordinality: grade 1=no disease progression; grade 2=development of varices; grade 3 = bleeding alone; grade 4=nonbleeding single decompensation; grade 5=more than one decompensating event; and grade 6=death. At the 60-month time point, patients were distributed in grades 1 through 6 as follows: 129, 43, 2, 7, 5, and 16, respectively. Emulation of a clinical trial performed by dividing patients based on baseline platelet count into two groups (cutoff 150Ã109/L) demonstrated a statistically significant outcome difference between groups when using ordinal outcomes not detectable by binary logistic or chi-square or time-to-event analyses. Additionally, using ordinal outcomes in a hypothetical study to prevent decompensation resulted in sample size estimates 3-to 4-fold lower than using a binary composite endpoint. Conclusion: Compared to traditional binary outcomes, the use of ordinal outcomes in trials of cirrhosis decompensation may provide more power and thus may require a smaller sample size.},

We show how baseline covariate data from the entire cohort, and treatment and outcome data only from randomized individuals, can be used to identify potential (counterfactual) outcome means and average treatment effects in the target population of all eligible individuals. We review identifiability conditions, propose estimators, and assess the estimators' finite-sample performance in simulation studies. As an illustration, we apply the estimators in a trial nested within a cohort of trial-eligible individuals to compare coronary artery bypass grafting surgery plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone for chronic coronary artery disease.

  abstract = {With the continued increase in the use of Bayesian methods in drug development, there is a need for statisticians to have tools to develop robust and defensible informative prior distributions. Whilst relevant empirical data should, where possible, provide the basis for such priors, it is often the case that limitations in data and/or our understanding may preclude direct construction of a dataâbased prior. Formal expert elicitation methods are a key technique that can be used to determine priors in these situations. Within GlaxoSmithKline, we have adopted a structured approach to prior elicitation on the basis of the SHELF elicitation framework and routinely use this in conjunction with calculation of probability of success (assurance) of the next study(s) to inform internal decision making at key project milestones. The aim of this paper is to share our experiences of embedding the use of prior elicitation within a large pharmaceutical company, highlighting both the benefits and challenges of prior elicitation through a series of case studies. We have found that putting team beliefs into the shape of a quantitative probability distribution provides a firm anchor for all internal decision making, enabling teams to provide investment boards with formally appropriate estimates of the probability of trial success as well as robust plans for interim decision rules where appropriate. As an added benefit, the elicitation process provides transparency about the beliefs and risks of the potential medicine, ultimately enabling better portfolio and companyâwide decision making.},

The data-structure is complicated by a number of factors, two of which are examined here: selection bias and unstable population. Under reasonable conditions, no correction for selection bias is required when assessing probabilities for diseases based on symptom information, and it is suggested that these "diagnostic distributions" should form the principal object of study. Transformation of these distributions under changing population structure is considered and shown to take on a simple form in many situations. It is argued that the prevailing paradigm of diagnostic statistics, which concentrates on incidence of symptoms for given disease, is largely inappropriate and should be replaced by an emphasis on diagnostic distributions. The generalized logistic model is seen to fit naturally into the new framework.},

  abstract = {Background The~sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) is increasingly used as an endpoint in intensive care randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Although serially measured SOFA is independently associated with mortality in observational cohorts, the association between treatment effects on SOFA vs. effects on mortality has not yet been quantified in RCTs. The aim of this study was to quantify the relationship between SOFA and mortality in RCTs and to identify which SOFA derivative best reflects between-group mortality differences. Methods The review protocol was prospectively registered (Prospero CRD42016034014). We performed a literature search (up to May 1, 2016) for RCTs reporting both SOFA and mortality, and analyzed between-group differences in these outcomes. Treatment effects on SOFA and mortality were calculated as the between-group SOFA standardized difference and log odds ratio (OR), respectively. We used random-effects meta-regression to (1) quantify the linear relationship between RCT treatment effects on mortality (logOR) and SOFA (i.e. responsiveness) and (2) quantify residual heterogeneity (i.e. consistency, expressed as I 2). Results Of 110 eligible RCTs, 87 qualified for analysis. Using all RCTs, SOFA was significantly associated with mortality (slope\,=\,0.49 (95\% CI 0.17; 0.82), p\,=\,0.006, I 2\,=\,5\%); the overall mortality effect explained by SOFA score (R 2) was 9\%. Fifty-eight RCTs used Fixed-day SOFA as an endpoint (i.e. the score on a fixed day after randomization), 25 studies used Delta SOFA as an endpoint (i.e. the trajectory from baseline score) and 15 studies used other SOFA derivatives as an endpoint. Fixed-day SOFA was not significantly associated with mortality (slope\,=\,0.35 (95\% CI â0.04; 0.75), p\,=\,0.08, I 2\,=\,12\%) and explained 3\% of the overall mortality effect (R 2). Delta SOFA was significantly associated with mortality (slope\,=\,0.70 (95\% CI 0.26; 1.14), p\,=\,0.004, I 2\,=\,0\%) and explained 32\% of the overall mortality effect (R 2). Conclusions Treatment effects on Delta SOFA appear to be reliably and consistently associated with mortality in RCTs. Fixed-day SOFA was the most frequently reported outcome among the reviewed RCTs, but was not significantly associated with mortality. Based on this study, we recommend using Delta SOFA rather than Fixed-day SOFA as an endpoint in future RCTs.

Sometimes different sources of knowledge are available, possibly leading to divergent posterior distributions and inferences. Research has been recently devoted to the development of sample size criteria that guarantee agreement of posterior information in terms of credible intervals when multiple priors are available. In these articles, the goals of reaching consensus and evidence are typically kept separated. Adopting a Bayesian performance-based approach, the present article proposes new sample size criteria for superiority trials that jointly control the achievement of both minimal evidence and consensus, measured by appropriate functions of the posterior distributions. We develop both an average criterion and a more stringent criterion that accounts for the entire predictive distributions of the selected measures of minimal evidence and consensus. Methods are developed and illustrated via simulation for trials involving binary outcomes. A real clinical trial example on Covid-19 vaccine data is presented.},

  abstract = {Recently, optional stopping has been a subject of debate in the Bayesian psychology community. Rouder (Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review 21(2), 301â308, 2014) argues that optional stopping is no problem for Bayesians, and even recommends the use of optional stopping in practice, as do (Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom, van der Maas \& Kievit, Perspectives on Psychological Science 7, 627â633, 2012). This article addresses the question of whether optional stopping is problematic for Bayesian methods, and specifies under which circumstances and in which sense it is and is not. By slightly varying and extending Rouderâs (Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review 21(2), 301â308, 2014) experiments, we illustrate that, as soon as the parameters of interest are equipped with default or pragmatic priorsâwhich means, in most practical applications of Bayes factor hypothesis testingâresilience to optional stopping can break down. We distinguish between three types of default priors, each having their own specific issues with optional stopping, ranging from no-problem-at-all (type 0 priors) to quite severe (type II priors).},

  abstract = {The method of generalized pairwise comparisons (GPC) is a multivariate extension of the well-known non-parametric WilcoxonâMannâWhitney test. It allows comparing two groups of observations based on multiple hierarchically ordered endpoints, regardless of the number or type of the latter. The summary measure, ânet benefit,â quantifies the difference between the probabilities that a random observation from one group is doing better than an observation from the opposite group. The method takes into account the correlations between the endpoints. We have performed a simulation study for the case of two hierarchical endpoints to evaluate the impact of their correlation on the type-I error probability and power of the test based on GPC. The simulations show that the power of the GPC test for the primary endpoint is modified if the secondary endpoint is included in the hierarchical GPC analysis. The change in power depends on the correlation between the endpoints. Interestingly, a decrease in power can occur, regardless of whether there is any marginal treatment effect on the secondary endpoint. It appears that the overall power of the hierarchical GPC procedure depends, in a complex manner, on the entire varianceâcovariance structure of the set of outcomes. Any additional factors (such as thresholds of clinical relevance, drop out, or censoring scheme) will also affect the power and will have to be taken into account when designing a trial based on the hierarchical GPC procedure.},

Evaluation of various statistical techniques that have been developed for mixed data in simulated environments necessarily requires joint generation of multiple variables. Most massive public health data sets include different types of variables. For instance, in clustered or longitudinal designs, often multiple variables are measured or observed for each individual or at each occasion. This work is motivated by a need to jointly generate binary and possibly non-normal continuous variables. We illustrate the use of power polynomials to simulate multivariate mixed data on the basis of a real adolescent smoking study. We believe that our proposed technique for simulating such intensive data has the potential to be a handy methodological addition to public health researchers' toolkit.},

An enumerative study has for its aim an estimate of the number of units of a frame that belong to a specified class. An analytic study has for its aim a basis for action on the cause-system or the process, in order to improve product of the future. A fair price to pay for an inventory is an example of an enumerative study. Tests of varieties of wheat, insecticides, drugs, manufacturing processes, are examples of analytic studies: the choice of variety or treatment will affect the future out-turn of wheat, future patients, future product. Techniques and methods of inference that are applicable to enumerative studies lead to faulty design and faulty inference for analytic problems. It is possible, in an enumerative problem, to reduce errors of sampling to any specified level. In contrast, in an analytic problem, it is impossible to compute the risk of making a wrong decision. The author provides a number of examples, and pleads for greater care in the writing and teaching of statistical theory and inference.},

  abstract = {Bayesian statistical methods are slowly creeping into all fields of science and are becoming ever more popular in applied research. Although it is very attractive to use Bayesian statistics, our personal experience has led us to believe that naively applying Bayesian methods can be dangerous for at least 3 main reasons: the potential influence of priors, misinterpretation of Bayesian features and results, and improper reporting of Bayesian results. To deal with these 3 points of potential danger, we have developed a succinct checklist: the WAMBS-checklist (When to worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics). The purpose of the questionnaire is to describe 10 main points that should be thoroughly checked when applying Bayesian analysis. We provide an account of "when to worry" for each of these issues related to: (a) issues to check before estimating the model, (b) issues to check after estimating the model but before interpreting results, (c) understanding the influence of priors, and (d) actions to take after interpreting results. To accompany these key points of concern, we will present diagnostic tools that can be used in conjunction with the development and assessment of a Bayesian model. We also include examples of how to interpret results when "problems" in estimation arise, as well as syntax and instructions for implementation. Our aim is to stress the importance of openness and transparency of all aspects of Bayesian estimation, and it is our hope that the WAMBS questionnaire can aid in this process.

Due to the limited study size, the p-values of testing whether the rate is higher in the treatment group across all types of adverse events are in general not uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the treatment group and the placebo group. A consequence is that typically fewer than percent of the hypotheses are rejected under the null at the nominal significance level of . The other challenge is multiplicity control. Adverse events from the same body system may be correlated. There may also be correlations between adverse events from different body systems. To tackle these challenging issues, we develop Monte-Carlo-based methods for the signal identification from patient-reported adverse events in clinical trials. The proposed methodologies account for the rare events and arbitrary correlation structures among adverse events within and/or between body systems. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately control the family-wise error rate and is more powerful than existing methods under many practical situations. Application to two real examples is provided.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are an intuitive yet rigorous tool to communicate about causal questions in clinical and epidemiologic research and inform study design and statistical analysis. DAGs are constructed to depict prior knowledge about biological and behavioral systems related to specific causal research questions. DAG components portray who receives treatment or experience exposures; mechanisms by which treatments and exposures operate; and other factors that influence the outcome of interest or which persons are included in an analysis. Once assembled, DAGs â via a few simple rules â guide the researcher in identifying whether the causal effect of interest can be identified without bias and, if so, what must be done either in study design or data analysis to achieve this. Specifically, DAGs can identify variables that, if controlled for in the design or analysis phase, are sufficient to eliminate confounding and some forms of selection bias. DAGs also help recognize variables that, if controlled for, bias the analysis (e.g., mediators or factors influenced by both exposure and outcome). Finally, DAGs help researchers recognize insidious sources of bias introduced by selection of individuals into studies or failure to completely observe all individuals until study outcomes are reached. DAGs, however, are not infallible, largely owing to limitations in prior knowledge about the system in question. In such instances, several alternative DAGs are plausible, and researchers should assess whether results differ meaningfully across analyses guided by different DAGs and be forthright about uncertainty. DAGs are powerful tools to guide the conduct of clinical research.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Understanding and characterizing treatment effect variation in randomized experiments has become essential for going beyond the âblack boxâ of the average treatment effect. Nonetheless, traditional statistical approaches often ignore or assume away such variation. In the context of randomized experiments, this article proposes a framework for decomposing overall treatment effect variation into a systematic component explained by observed covariates and a remaining idiosyncratic component. Our framework is fully randomization-based, with estimates of treatment effect variation that are entirely justified by the randomization itself. Our framework can also account for noncompliance, which is an important practical complication. We make several contributions. First, we show that randomization-based estimates of systematic variation are very similar in form to estimates from fully interacted linear regression and two-stage least squares. Second, we use these estimators to develop an omnibus test for systematic treatment effect variation, both with and without noncompliance. Third, we propose an R2-like measure of treatment effect variation explained by covariates and, when applicable, noncompliance. Finally, we assess these methods via simulation studies and apply them to the Head Start Impact Study, a large-scale randomized experiment.

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Objective{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}In clinical trials, the relative risk or risk ratio (RR) is a mainstay of reporting of the effect magnitude for an intervention. The RR is the ratio of the probability of an outcome in an intervention group to its probability in a control group. Thus the RR provides a measure of change in the likelihood of an event linked to a given intervention. This measure has been widely used because it is today considered a measure with âportability' across varying outcome prevalence, especially when the outcome is rare. It turns out however that there is a much more important problem with this ratio, and this paper aims to demonstrate this problem.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We used mathematical derivation to determine if the RR is a measure of effect magnitude alone (i.e. a larger absolute value always indicating a stronger effect) or not. We also used the same derivation to determine its relationship to prevalence of an outcome. We confirm the derivation results with a follow-up analysis of 140,620 trials scraped from the Cochrane.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We demonstrate that the RR varies for reasons other than magnitude of the effect because it is a ratio of two posterior probabilities, both of which are dependent on baseline prevalence of an outcome. Additionally we demonstrate that the RR shifts towards its null value with increasing outcome prevalence. The shift towards the null happens regardless of the strength of the association between intervention and outcome. The odds ratio (OR), the other commonly used ratio, measures solely the effect magnitude and has no relationship to prevalence of an outcome in a study nor does it overestimate the RR as is commonly thought.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusions{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The results demonstrate the need to a) end the primary use of the RR in clinical trials and meta-analyses as its direct interpretation is not meaningful; b) replace the RR by the OR; and c) only use the post-intervention risk recalculated from the OR for any expected level of baseline risk in absolute terms for purposes of interpretation such as the number needed to treat. These results will have far reaching implications such as reducing misleading results from clinical trials and meta-analyses and ushering in a new era in the reporting of such trials or meta-analyses in practice.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In âThe Future of Data Analysis,â he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or âdata analysis.â Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name âdata scienceâ for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of âdata scienceâ programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M âData Science Initiativeâ that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as âcultural appropriation.â This article reviews some ingredients of the current âdata science moment,â including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for âscaling upâ to âbig data.â This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere âscaling up,â but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are âlearning from data,â and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than todayâs data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

We then point out that, if the treatment has long-term benefit from a more important but less frequent endpoint (eg, death), the win ratio can show that benefit by following patients longer, avoiding masking by more frequent but less important outcomes, which occurs in conventional time-to-first-event analyses. For the situation of nonproportional hazards, we demonstrate that the win ratio can be a good alternative to methods such as landmark survival rate, restricted mean survival time, and weighted log-rank tests.},

  abstract = {Individuals differ in how they respond to a given treatment. In an effort to predict the treatment response and analyze the heterogeneity of treatment effect, we propose a general modeling framework by identifying treatment-covariate interactions honoring a hierarchical condition. We construct a single-step l1 norm penalty procedure that maintains the hierarchical structure of interactions in the sense that a treatment-covariate interaction term is included in the model only when either the covariate or both the covariate and treatment have nonzero main effects. We developed a constrained Lasso approach with two parameterization schemes that enforce the hierarchical interaction restriction differently. We solved the resulting constrained optimization problem using a spectral projected gradient method. We compared our methods to the unstructured Lasso using simulation studies including a scenario that violates the hierarchical condition (misspecified model). The simulations showed that our methods yielded more parsimonious models and outperformed the unstructured Lasso for correctly identifying nonzero treatment-covariate interactions. The superior performance of our methods are also corroborated by an application to a large randomized clinical trial data investigating a drug for treating congestive heart failure (N = 2569). Our methods provide a well-suited approach for doing secondary analysis in clinical trials to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects and to identify predictive biomarkers.},

The present work aims to demonstrate how DAG-based data simulation can be used to understand bias and compare data analytical strategies in an educational context. Examples based on classical confounding situations and an M-DAG are examined and used to introduce basic concepts and demonstrate some important features of regression analysis, as well as the harmful effect of adjusting for a collider variable. Other potential uses of DAG-based data simulation include systematic comparisons of data analytical strategies or the evaluation of the role of uncertainties in a hypothesized DAG structure, including other types of bias such as information bias. DAG-based data simulations, like those presented here, should facilitate the exploration of several key epidemiological concepts, DAG theory and data analysis. Some suggestions are also made on how to further expand the ideas from this study.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to estimation of the cumulative incidence function in the presence of competing risks. The underlying statistical model is specified via a mixture factorization of the joint distribution of the event type and the time to the event. The time to event distributions conditional on the event type are modeled using smooth semi-nonparametric densities. One strength of this approach is that it can handle arbitrary censoring and truncation while relying on mild parametric assumptions. A stepwise forward algorithm for model estimation and adaptive selection of smooth semi-nonparametric polynomial degrees is presented, implemented in the statistical software R, evaluated in a sequence of simulation studies, and applied to data from a clinical trial in cryptococcal meningitis. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed method frequently outperforms both parametric and nonparametric alternatives. They also support the use of 'ad hoc' asymptotic inference to derive confidence intervals. An extension to regression modeling is also presented, and its potential and challenges are discussed.},

  abstract = {It is widely accepted that gene expression classifiers need to be externally validated by showing that they predict the outcome well enough on other patients than those from whose data the classifier was derived. Unfortunately, the gain in predictive accuracy by the classifier as compared to established clinical prognostic factors often is not quantified. Our objective is to illustrate the application of appropriate statistical measures for this purpose. In order to compare the predictive accuracies of a model based on the clinical factors only and of a model based on the clinical factors plus the gene classifier, we compute the decrease in predictive inaccuracy and the proportion of explained variation. These measures have been obtained for three studies of published gene classifiers: for survival of lymphoma patients, for survival of breast cancer patients and for the diagnosis of lymph node metastases in head and neck cancer. For the three studies our results indicate varying and possibly small added explained variation and predictive accuracy due to gene classifiers. Therefore, the gain of future gene classifiers should routinely be demonstrated by appropriate statistical measures, such as the ones we recommend.},

  abstract = {Limited information exists regarding predictors of general quality of life following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with up to six-year follow-up. We hypothesized that certain variables evaluated at the time of ACL reconstruction will predict the general quality of life as measured by the Short Form-36 (SF-36). All unilateral ACL reconstructions from 2002 to 2004 in patients currently enrolled in a prospective multicenter cohort were evaluated. Patients preoperatively completed the SF-36 validated outcome instrument. Surgeons documented intra-articular pathological conditions and treatment, as well as the ACL reconstruction surgical technique. At baseline and at a minimum of two and six years postoperatively, patients completed the SF-36. Longitudinal analysis was performed for the two-year and six-year end points. Of the initial 1512 subjects, at least one follow-up questionnaire was obtained from 1411 subjects (93\%). The cohort was 44\% female, and the median patient age at enrollment was twenty-three years. The mean scores were 41.9 points for the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and 51.7 points for the Mental Component Summary (MCS) at baseline, 53.6 points for the PCS and 52.0 points for the MCS at two years, and 54.0 points for the PCS and 52.4 points for the MCS at six years. Significant predictors of a higher PCS score were a higher baseline PCS score, younger age, lower baseline body mass index, having {$>$}50\% of the lateral meniscus excised, or having no treatment done on a lateral meniscal tear. In contrast, significant predictors of a lower PCS score were a shorter follow-up time since surgery, revision ACL reconstruction, smoking at baseline, fewer years of education, and chondromalacia of the lateral tibial plateau. The mean utility gained at six years after ACL reconstruction was 5.3 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Large improvements in the PCS (with an effect size of 1.2) were noted at two years and were maintained at six years after ACL reconstruction. Lower education and smoking were significant predictors of lower PCS and MCS scores. ACL reconstruction resulted in a relatively high gain of QALYs.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to help define the indications for rotator cuff repair by identifying predictors of failure of nonoperative treatment. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, cohort study design was used. All patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears on magnetic resonance imaging were offered participation. Baseline data from this cohort were used to examine risk factors for failing a standard rehabilitation protocol. Patients who underwent surgery were defined as failing nonoperative treatment. A Cox proportional hazards model was fit to determinethe baseline factors that predicted failure. The dependent variable was time to surgery. The independent variables were tear severity and baseline patient factors: age, activity level, body mass index, sex, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, visual analog scale score for pain, education, handedness, comorbidities, duration of symptoms, strength, employment, smoking status, and patient expectations. RESULTS: Of the 433 subjects in this study, 87 underwent surgery with 93\% follow-up at 1 year and 88\% follow-up at 2 years. The median age was 62 years, and 49\% were female patients. Multivariate modeling, adjusted for the covariates listed previously, identified patient expectations regarding physical therapy (P\,{$<$}\,.0001) as the strongest predictor of surgery. Higher activity level (P\,=\,.011) and not smoking (P\,=\,.023) were also significant predictors of surgery. CONCLUSION: A patient's decision to undergo surgery is influenced more by low expectations regarding the effectiveness of physical therapy than by patient symptoms or anatomic features of the rotator cuff tear. As such, patient symptoms and anatomic features of the chronic rotator cuff tear may not be the best features to use when deciding on surgical intervention.},

  abstract = {Ordinal responses are very common in longitudinal data collected from substance abuse research or other behavioral research. This study develops a new statistical model with free SAS macros that can be applied to characterize time-varying effects on ordinal responses. Our simulation study shows that the ordinal-scale time-varying effects model has very low estimation bias and sometimes offers considerably better performance when fitting data with ordinal responses than a model that treats the response as continuous. Contrary to a common assumption that an ordinal scale with several levels can be treated as continuous, our results indicate that it is not so much the number of levels on the ordinal scale but rather the skewness of the distribution that makes a difference on relative performance of linear versus ordinal models. We use longitudinal data from a well-known study on youth at high risk for substance abuse as a motivating example to demonstrate that the proposed model can characterize the time-varying effect of negative peer influences on alcohol use in a way that is more consistent with the developmental theory and existing literature, in comparison with the linear time-varying effect model.},

  abstract = {Calibration is a vital aspect of the performance of risk prediction models, but research in the context of ordinal outcomes is scarce. This study compared calibration measures for risk models predicting a discrete ordinal outcome, and investigated the impact of the proportional odds assumption on calibration and overfitting. We studied the multinomial, cumulative, adjacent category, continuation ratio, and stereotype logit/logistic models. To assess calibration, we investigated calibration intercepts and slopes, calibration plots, and the estimated calibration index. Using large sample simulations, we studied the performance of models for risk estimation under various conditions, assuming that the true model has either a multinomial logistic form or a cumulative logit proportional odds form. Small sample simulations were used to compare the tendency for overfitting between models. As a case study, we developed models to diagnose the degree of coronary artery disease (five categories) in symptomatic patients. When the true model was multinomial logistic, proportional odds models often yielded poor risk estimates, with calibration slopes deviating considerably from unity even on large model development datasets. The stereotype logistic model improved the calibration slope, but still provided biased risk estimates for individual patients. When the true model had a cumulative logit proportional odds form, multinomial logistic regression provided biased risk estimates, although these biases were modest. Nonproportional odds models require more parameters to be estimated from the data, and hence suffered more from overfitting. Despite larger sample size requirements, we generally recommend multinomial logistic regression for risk prediction modeling of discrete ordinal outcomes.},

  abstract = {Bayesian statistics, a currently controversial viewpoint concerning statistical inference, is based on a definition of probability as a particular measure of the opinions of ideally consistent people. Statistical inference is modification of these opinions in the light of evidence, and Bayes' theorem specifies how such modifications should be made. The tools of Bayesian statistics include the theory of specific distributions and the principle of stable estimation, which specifies when actual prior opinions may be satisfactorily approximated by a uniform distribution. A common feature of many classical significance tests is that a sharp null hypothesis is compared with a diffuse alternative hypothesis. Often evidence which, for a Bayesian statistician, strikingly supports the null hypothesis leads to rejection of that hypothesis by standard classical procedures. The likelihood principle emphasized in Bayesian statistics implies, among other things, that the rules governing when data collection stops are irrelevant to data interpretation. It is entirely appropriate to collect data until a point has been proven or disproven, or until the data collector runs out of time, money, or patience.},

Importance sampling formulas take on an easy form relating to the deviance in exponential families and are particularly simple starting from Jeffreys invariant prior. Because of the i.i.d. nature of bootstrap sampling, familiar formulas describe the computational accuracy of the Bayes estimates. Besides computational methods, the theory provides a connection between Bayesian and frequentist analysis. Efficient algorithms for the frequentist accuracy of Bayesian inferences are developed and demonstrated in a model selection example.},

  abstract = {Missing outcome data constitute a serious threat to the validity and precision of inferences from randomized controlled trials. In this paper, we propose the use of a multistate Markov model for the analysis of incomplete individual patient data for a dichotomous outcome reported over a period of time. The model accounts for patients dropping out of the study and also for patients relapsing. The time of each observation is accounted for, and the model allows the estimation of time-dependent relative treatment effects. We apply our methods to data from a study comparing the effectiveness of 2 pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. The model jointly estimates the relative efficacy and the dropout rate and also allows for a wide range of clinically interesting inferences to be made. Assumptions about the missingness mechanism and the unobserved outcomes of patients dropping out can be incorporated into the analysis. The presented method constitutes a viable candidate for analyzing longitudinal, incomplete binary data.},

We aimed to investigate the statistical properties of several strategies for the simultaneous analysis of function and mortality in ALS clinical trials. Methods: Based on the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) database, we simulated longitudinal patterns of functional decline, defined by the revised amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) and conditional survival time. Different treatment scenarios with varying effect sizes were simulated with follow-up ranging from 12 to 18\&nbsp;months. We considered the following analytical strategies: 1) Cox model; 2) linear mixed effects (LME) model; 3) omnibus test based on Cox and LME models; 4) composite time-to-6-point decrease or death; 5) combined assessment of function and survival (CAFS); and 6) test based on joint modeling framework. For each analytical strategy, we calculated the empirical power and sample size. Results: Both Cox and LME models have increased false-negative rates when treatment exclusively affects either function or survival. The joint model has superior power compared to other strategies. The composite end point increases false-negative rates among all treatment scenarios. To detect a 15\% reduction in ALSFRS-R decline and 34\% decline in hazard with 80\% power after 18\&nbsp;months, the Cox model requires 524 patients, the LME model 794 patients, the omnibus test 526 patients, the composite end point 1,274 patients, the CAFS 576 patients and the joint model 464 patients. Conclusion: Joint models have superior statistical power to analyze simultaneous effects on survival and function and may circumvent pitfalls encountered by other end points. Optimizing trial end points is essential, as selecting suboptimal outcomes may disguise important treatment clues. Keywords: joint models, CAFS, clinical trials, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis},

Propensity score methods have theoretical advantages over conventional covariate adjustment, but their relative performance in real-word scenarios is poorly characterized. We used datasets from 4 large-scale cardiovascular observational studies (PROMETHEUS, ADAPT-DES [the Assessment of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy with Drug-Eluting Stents], THIN [The Health Improvement Network], and CHARM [Candesartan in Heart Failure-Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity]) to compare the performance of conventional covariate adjustment with 4 common PS methods: matching, stratification, inverse probability weighting, and use of PS as a covariate. We found that stratification performed poorly with few outcome events, and inverse probability weighting gave imprecise estimates of treatment effect and undue influence to a small number of observations when substantial confounding was present. Covariate adjustment and matching performed well in all of our examples, although matching tended to give less precise estimates in some cases. PS methods are not necessarily superior to conventional covariate adjustment, and care should be taken to~select the most suitable method.},

  abstract = {Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is a sensitive marker of blood glucose in patients with diabetes. However, levels can vary considerably, even amongst individuals with similar mean blood glucose concentrations. Other glycated proteins, such as fructosamine, can also act as blood sugar markers, but estimating HbA1c and fructosamine via independent models may lead to errors of interpretation regarding disease severity. From a clinical standpoint, it would be of great interest to know the factors that affect the mean concentration of both HbA1c and fructosamine, which influence the variability in the concentrations of these glycated markers and cause HbA1c/fructosamine discordance. Flexible models are required to illustrate the behaviour of these variables as well as the association between them. This work reviews existing models that might serve in this regard. Flexible copula regression models using splines were used to provide a better understanding of the behaviour of both glycated proteins and the relationship between them under the possible influence of different covariates. This work shows the usefulness of this type of models in practise and provides a basis for their clinical interpretation by means of an understandable case study. Ultimately, to better understand the effects of each continuous covariate, they are represented at the true scale of the response variables.},

It is common practice to adjust for as many variables as possible in observational studies in the hopes of reducing confounding by other variables. However, indiscriminate adjustment for variables using standard regression models may actually lead to biased estimates. In this paper, we differentiate between confounders, mediators, colliders, and effect modifiers. We will discuss that while confounders should be adjusted for in the analysis, one should be wary of adjusting for colliders. Mediators should not be adjusted for when examining the total effect of an exposure on an outcome. Automated statistical programs should not be used to decide which variables to include in causal models. Using a case scenario in cardiology, we will demonstrate how to identify confounders, colliders, mediators and effect modifiers and the implications of adjustment or non-adjustment for each of them.},

The Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group strives to overcome these challenges through innovative trial design. Response adjusted for duration of antibiotic risk (RADAR) is a novel methodology utilizing a superiority design and a 2-step process: (1) categorizing patients into an overall clinical outcome (based on benefits and harms), and (2) ranking patients with respect to a desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR). DOORs are constructed by assigning higher ranks to patients with (1) better overall clinical outcomes and (2) shorter durations of antibiotic use for similar overall clinical outcomes. DOOR distributions are compared between antibiotic use strategies. The probability that a randomly selected patient will have a better DOOR if assigned to the new strategy is estimated. DOOR/RADAR represents a new paradigm in assessing the risks and benefits of new strategies to optimize antibiotic use.},

Accomplishing pragmatism requires better summaries of the totality of the evidence in ways that clinical trials consumersâpatients, physicians, insurersâfind transparent and allow for informed benefit:risk decision-making.The current approach to the analysis of clinical trials is to analyze efficacy and safety separately and then combine these analyses into a benefit:risk assessment. Many assume that this will effectively describe the impact on patients. But this approach is suboptimal for evaluating the totality of effects on patients.We discuss methods for benefit:risk assessment that have greater pragmatism than methods that separately analyze efficacy and safety. These include the concepts of within-patient analyses and composite benefit:risk endpoints with a goal of understanding how to analyze one patient before trying to figure out how to analyze many. We discuss the desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) and introduce the partial credit strategy using an example in a clinical trial evaluating the effects of a new antibiotic. As part of the example, we introduce a strategy to engage patients as a resource to inform benefit:risk analyses consistent with the goal of measuring and weighing outcomes that are most important from the patient's perspective.We describe a broad vision for the future of clinical trials consistent with increased pragmatism. Greater focus on using endpoints to analyze patients rather than patients to analyze endpoints particularly in late-phase/stage clinical trials is an important part of this vision.},

We derive a test statistic based on the HosmerâLemeshow test for binary logistic regression. Using a simulation study, we investigate the distribution and power properties of this test and compare these with those of three other goodness-of-fit tests. The new test has lower power than the existing tests; however, it was able to detect a greater number of the different types of lack of fit considered in this study. Moreover, the test allows for the results to be summarized in a contingency table of observed and estimated frequencies, which is a useful supplementary tool to assess model fit. We illustrate the ability of the tests to detect lack of fit using a study of aftercare decisions for psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents. The test proposed in this paper is similar to a recently developed goodness-of-fit test for multinomial logistic regression. A unified approach for testing goodness of fit is now available for binary, multinomial, and ordinal logistic regression models.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon known as the winner's curse is a form of selection bias that affects estimates of genetic association. In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) the bias is exacerbated by the use of stringent selection thresholds and ranking over hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We develop an improved multi-locus bootstrap point estimate and confidence interval, which accounts for both ranking- and threshold-selection bias in the presence of genome-wide SNP linkage disequilibrium structure. The bootstrap method easily adapts to various study designs and alternative test statistics as well as complex SNP selection criteria. The latter is demonstrated by our application to the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium findings, in which the selection criterion was the minimum of the p-values for the additive and genotypic genetic effect models. In contrast, existing likelihood-based bias-reduced estimators account for the selection criterion applied to an SNP as if it were the only one tested, and so are more simple computationally, but do not address ranking across SNPs. Our simulation studies show that the bootstrap bias-reduced estimates are usually closer to the true genetic effect than the likelihood estimates and are less variable with a narrower confidence interval. Replication study sample size requirements computed from the bootstrap bias-reduced estimates are adequate 75â90 per cent of the time compared to 53-60 per cent of the time for the likelihood method. The bootstrap methods are implemented in a user-friendly package able to provide point and interval estimation for both binary and quantitative phenotypes in large-scale GWAS.},

The natural parameter for the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test is the Mann-Whitney parameter, Ï, which measures the probability that a randomly selected individual in the treatment arm will have a larger response than a randomly selected individual in the control arm (plus an adjustment for ties). We show that the Mann-Whitney parameter may be framed as a causal parameter and show that it is not equal to a closely related and nonidentifiable causal effect, Ï, the probability that a randomly selected individual will have a larger response under treatment than under control (plus an adjustment for ties). We review the paradox, first expressed by Hand, that the Ï parameter may imply that the treatment is worse (or better) than control, while the Mann-Whitney parameter shows the opposite. Unlike the Mann-Whitney parameter, Ï is nonidentifiable from a randomized experiment. We review some nonparametric assumptions that rule out Hand's paradox through bounds on Ï and use bootstrap methods to make inferences on those bounds. We explore the relationship of the proportional odds parameter to Hand's paradox, showing that the paradox may occur for proportional odds parameters between 1/9 and 9. Thus, large effects are needed to ensure that if treatment appears better by the Mann-Whitney parameter, then treatment improves responses in most individuals. We demonstrate these issues using a vaccine trial.},

Salivary cortisol was collected one day per week for 15 weeks by 98 primary caregivers of children with ASD. Overall, parents perceived high levels of stress at baseline. Mean morning cortisol increase was below expected levels for healthy adults, and perception of stress predicted morning cortisol activity. Hypocorticolism related to chronic stress may be present in parents of children with ASD.

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Outcome measures that integrate mortality and morbidity, like quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), have been proposed for critical care clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: We sought to describe the distribution of QALYs in critically ill patients and estimate sample size requirements for a hypothetical trial using QALYs as the primary outcome. METHODS: We used data from a prospective cohort study of survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome to generate utility values and calculate QALYs at 6 and 12 months. Using multiple simulations, we estimated the required sample sizes for multiple outcome scenarios in a hypothetical trial, including a base-case wherein the intervention improved both mortality and QALYs among survivors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: From 195 enrolled patients, follow-up was sufficient to generate QALY outcomes for 168 (86.2\%) at 6 months and 159 (81.5\%) at 1 year. For a hypothetical intervention that reduced mortality from 48 to 44\% and improved QALYs by 0.025 in survivors at 6 months, the required per-group sample size was 571 (80\% power; two-sided Î± = 0.05), compared with 2,436 patients needed for a comparison focusing on mortality alone. When only mortality or QALY in survivors (but not both) showed improvement by these amounts, 3,426 and 1,827 patients per group were needed, respectively. When mortality and morbidity effects moved in opposite directions, simulation results became impossible to interpret. CONCLUSIONS: QALYs may be a feasible outcome in critical care trials yielding a patient-centered result and major gains in statistical power under certain conditions, but this approach is susceptible to several threats, including loss to follow-up.},

  abstract = {Randomized vaccine trials are used to assess vaccine efficacy (VE) and to characterize the durability of vaccine-induced protection. If efficacy is demonstrated, the treatment of placebo volunteers becomes an issue. For COVID-19 vaccine trials, there is broad consensus that placebo volunteers should be offered a vaccine once efficacy has been established. This will likely lead to most placebo volunteers crossing over to the vaccine arm, thus complicating the assessment of long term durability. We show how to analyze durability following placebo crossover and demonstrate that the VE profile that would be observed in a placebo controlled trial is recoverable in a trial with placebo crossover. This result holds no matter when the crossover occurs and with no assumptions about the form of the efficacy profile. We only require that the VE profile applies to the newly vaccinated irrespective of the timing of vaccination. We develop different methods to estimate efficacy within the context of a proportional hazards regression model and explore via simulation the implications of placebo crossover for estimation of VE under different efficacy dynamics and study designs. We apply our methods to simulated COVID-19 vaccine trials with durable and waning VE and a total follow-up of 2 years.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss a likelihood-based method for analysing correlated binary responses based on a multivariate model. It is related to the pseudo-maximum likelihood approach suggested recently by Zhao \&amp; Prentice (1990). Their parameterization results in a simple pairwise model, in which the association between responses is modelled in terms of correlations, while the present paper uses conditional log odds-ratios. With this approach, higher-order associations can be incorporated in a natural way. One important advantage of this parameterization is that the maximum likelihood estimates of the marginal mean parameters are robust to misspecification of the time dependence. We describe an iterative two-stage procedure for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates. Two examples are presented to illustrate this methodology.},

  abstract = {Composite endpoints are frequently used in clinical trials, but simple approaches, such as the time to first event, do not reflect any ordering among the endpoints. However, some endpoints, such as mortality, are worse than others. A variety of procedures have been proposed to reflect the severity of the individual endpoints such as pairwise ranking approaches, the win ratio, and the desirability of outcome ranking. When patients have different lengths of follow-up, however, ranking can be difficult and proposed methods do not naturally lead to regression approaches and require specialized software. This paper defines an ordering score O to operationalize the patient ranking implied by hierarchical endpoints. We show how differential right censoring of follow-up corresponds to multiple interval censoring of the ordering score allowing standard software for survival models to be used to calculate the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators (NPMLEs) of different measures. Additionally, if one assumes that the ordering score is transformable to an exponential random variable, a semiparametric regression is obtained, which is equivalent to the proportional hazards model subject to multiple interval censoring. Standard software can be used for estimation. We show that the NPMLE can be poorly behaved compared to the simple estimators in staggered entry trials. We also show that the semiparametric estimator can be more efficient than simple estimators and explore how standard Cox regression maneuvers can be used to assess model fit, allow for flexible generalizations, and assess interactions of covariates with treatment. We analyze a trial of short versus long-term antiplatelet therapy using our methods.},

  abstract = {We predict the onset of personal bankruptcy using least squares regression. Although well publicized, only 2,244 bankruptcies occur in our dataset of 2.9 million months of credit-card activity. We use stepwise selection to find predictors of these from a mix of payment history, debt load, demographics, and their interactions. This combination of rare responses and over 67,000 possible predictors leads to a challenging modeling question: How does one separate coincidental from useful predictors? We show that three modifications turn stepwise regression into an effective methodology for predicting bankruptcy. Our version of stepwise regression (1) organizes calculations to accommodate interactions, (2) exploits modern decision theoretic criteria to choose predictors, and (3) conservatively estimates p-values to handle sparse data and a binary response. Omitting any one of these leads to poor performance. A final step in our procedure calibrates regression predictions. With these modifications, stepwise regression predicts bankruptcy as well as, if not better than, recently developed data-mining tools. When sorted, the largest 14,000 resulting predictions hold 1,000 of the 1,800 bankruptcies hidden in a validation sample of 2.3 million observations. If the cost of missing a bankruptcy is 200 times that of a false positive, our predictions incur less than 2/3 of the costs of classification errors produced by the tree-based classifier C4.5.},

  abstract = {Selection and measurement of confounders is critical for successful adjustment in nonrandomized studies. Although the principles behind confounder selection are now well established, variable selection for confounder adjustment remains a difficult problem in practice, particularly in secondary analyses of databases. We present a simulation study that compares the high-dimensional propensity score algorithm for variable selection with approaches that utilize direct adjustment for all potential confounders via regularized regression, including ridge regression and lasso regression. Simulations were based on 2 previously published pharmacoepidemiologic cohorts and used the plasmode simulation framework to create realistic simulated data sets with thousands of potential confounders. Performance of methods was evaluated with respect to bias and mean squared error of the estimated effects of a binary treatment. Simulation scenarios varied the true underlying outcome model, treatment effect, prevalence of exposure and outcome, and presence of unmeasured confounding. Across scenarios, high-dimensional propensity score approaches generally performed better than regularized regression approaches. However, including the variables selected by lasso regression in a regular propensity score model also performed well and may provide a promising alternative variable selection method.

  abstract = {Nonrandomized studies of treatments from electronic healthcare databases are critical for producing the evidence necessary to making informed treatment decisions, but often rely on comparing rates of events observed in a small number of patients. In addition, studies constructed from electronic healthcare databases, for example, administrative claims data, often adjust for many, possibly hundreds, of potential confounders. Despite the importance of maximizing efficiency when there are many confounders and few observed outcome events, there has been relatively little research on the relative performance of different propensity score methods in this context. In this paper, we compare a wide variety of propensity-based estimators of the marginal relative risk. In contrast to prior research that has focused on specific statistical methods in isolation of other analytic choices, we instead consider a method to be defined by the complete multistep process from propensity score modeling to final treatment effect estimation. Propensity score model estimation methods considered include ordinary logistic regression, Bayesian logistic regression, lasso, and boosted regression trees. Methods for utilizing the propensity score include pair matching, full matching, decile strata, fine strata, regression adjustment using one or two nonlinear splines, inverse propensity weighting, and matching weights. We evaluate methods via a 'plasmode' simulation study, which creates simulated datasets on the basis of a real cohort study of two treatments constructed from administrative claims data. Our results suggest that regression adjustment and matching weights, regardless of the propensity score model estimation method, provide lower bias and mean squared error in the context of rare binary outcomes.

  abstract = {The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the gold standard for evaluating the causal effects of medications. Limitations of RCTs have led to increasing interest in using real-world evidence (RWE) to augment RCT evidence and inform decision making on medications. Although RWE can be either randomized or nonrandomized, nonrandomized RWE can capitalize on the recent proliferation of large healthcare databases and can often answer questions that cannot be answered in randomized studies due to resource constraints. However, the results of nonrandomized studies are much more likely to be impacted by confounding bias, and the existence of unmeasured confounders can never be completely ruled out. Furthermore, nonrandomized studies require more complex design considerations which can sometimes result in design-related biases. We discuss questions that can help investigators or evidence consumers evaluate the potential impact of confounding or other biases on their findings: Does the design emulate a hypothetical randomized trial design? Is the comparator or control condition appropriate? Does the primary analysis adjust for measured confounders? Do sensitivity analyses quantify the potential impact of residual confounding? Are methods open to inspection and (if possible) replication? Designing a high-quality nonrandomized study of medications remains challenging and requires broad expertise across a range of disciplines, including relevant clinical areas, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The questions posed in this paper provide a guiding framework for assessing the credibility of nonrandomized RWE and could be applied across many clinical questions.},

A three-decision rule, credited to Neyman or Wald, is presented that does not require the doubling of the p-value, and is consistent with a Bayesian approach.

  abstract = {All medical treatments have potential harms as well as benefits, and it is vital that everyone has a good understanding of what these might be, how dramatic they might be and how likely. In fact, in the UK, the Montgomery judgement in the supreme court in 2015 (see Box 1) has made it a legal necessity for patients to be given comprehensible, personally relevant information about all reasonable treatment options, including none.1 So, how should we ensure good, clear communication of relevant evidence? Box 1.  \#\#\# The Montgomery judgement In 1999, Nadine Montgomery was preparing for the birth of her son Sam. She was of small stature, with diabetes, and was concerned about being able to give birth naturally. Unfortunately, difficulties did arise during birth, and Sam suffered brain damage as a result. Her obstetrician had not discussed the risk of this particular complication occurring, deeming it best Nadine attempted a vaginal birth. On appeal at the supreme court, Nadine Montgomery won her case. This laid down a new legal basis for informed consent, in line with the General Medical Council guidelines;1  {$>$} âThe doctor is therefore under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments.â {$>$}  {$>$} âThe test of materiality is whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the patient's position would be likely to attach significance to the risk, or the doctor is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to it. â  {$>$}  {$>$} âThe assessment of whether a risk is material cannot be reduced to percentages.

  abstract = {Abnormal platelet reactivity is associated with recurrent ischemia and bleeding following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), encoded by F2R, is a high affinity thrombin receptor on platelets and the target of the antiplatelet drug vorapaxar. The intronic single nucleotide polymorphism F2R IVS-14 A/T affects PAR1 receptor density and function. We hypothesized that carriers of the T allele, who have been shown to have decreased platelet reactivity, would be at lower risk for thrombotic events, but higher risk for bleeding following PCI. Using BioVU, the Vanderbilt DNA repository linked to the electronic medical record, we studied 660 patients who underwent PCI for unstable or stable coronary artery disease. Primary outcome measures were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, composite of revascularization, MI, stroke, death) and bleeding (assessed by Bleeding Academic Research Consortium scale) over 24~months. The minor allele (T) frequency was 14.8~\%. There were no genotypic differences in the frequency of MACE (33.7, 28.8, and 31.6~\% for A/A, A/T, and T/T respectively, P~=~0.50) or bleeding (15.7, 14.7, and 18.8~\% for A/A, A/T, and T/T respectively, P~=~0.90). In a Cox regression model, fully adjusted for age, race, sex, BMI, and smoking status, carrying a T allele was not associated with MACE (HR 1.19, 95~\% CI 0.89-1.59, P~=~0.23) or bleeding (HR 0.73, 95~\% CI 0.37-1.4, P~=~0.34). In conclusion, in our population, F2R IVS-14 PAR1 variability does not affect risk of MACE or bleeding following PCI.},

  abstract = {Driveline infections (DLI) are a cause of morbidity after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implantation. Because driveline trauma contributes to DLI, we assessed whether intraoperative placement of a temporary external anchoring suture (EAS) influenced DLI rate. We analyzed 161 consecutive patients with CF-LVAD (HMII 82; HW 79) implantation. Two groups were defined: placement of EAS (n = 85) or No EAS (n = 76). For NO EAS patients, the driveline was permanently anchored internally to the rectus fascia. Cox proportional analysis was performed to assess the effect of EAS on time to first confirmed DLI. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups (all p = 0.3). Mean follow-up time was 0.93 years. A total of 18 (11.1\%) patients developed confirmed culture positive DLI, with "first infection" rate of 0.13 events/year. Mean time to confirmed DLI was 0.69 years. Driveline infection was less likely (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28, 0.95 confidence interval [CI] = 0.06-1.25, p = 0.056) to occur in NO EAS (2/18) then in EAS (16/18). Confirmed DLI was comparable between device types (p = 0.3). Multivariable regression adjusted for age, BMI, blood product use, device type, and diabetes showed equivocal effect of EAS (HR = 0.33, 0.95 CI = 0.07-1.54, p = 0.12). Patients with a temporary EAS may have an increased risk of confirmed DLI after device implantation.},

  abstract = {Analysis of recurrent events is becoming increasingly popular for understanding treatment effects in randomised controlled trials. The analysis of recurrent events can improve efficiency and capture disease burden compared to standard time-to-first event analyses. However, the added knowledge about the multi-state process comes at the cost of modelling complexity. High mortality rates can complicate matters even more. A case study using data from a randomised controlled trial, LEADER, is presented to highlight interpretation of common methods as well as potential pitfalls when analysing recurrent events in the presence of a competing risk. The presented methods either target features of the underlying intensity functions or marginal traits of a multi-state process which includes terminal events or not. In particular, approaches to handle death as a part of an event and as a competing risk are discussed. A new method targeting the marginal mean function for a composite endpoint, which includes both death as a component and as a competing risk, will be introduced. Finally, recommendations for how to capture meaningful treatment effects in randomised controlled trials when analysing recurrent and terminal events will be made.},

  abstract = {Neuregulin-1Î² (NRG-1Î²) is a growth factor critical for cardiac development and repair with therapeutic potential for heart failure. We previously showed that the glial growth factor 2 (GGF2) isoform of NRG-1Î² improves cardiac function in rodents after myocardial infarction (MI), but its efficacy in a large animal model of cardiac injury has not been examined. We therefore sought to examine the effects of GGF2 on ventricular remodeling, cardiac function, and global transcription in post-MI swine, as well as potential mechanisms for anti-remodeling effects. MI was induced in anesthetized swine (n=23) by intracoronary balloon occlusion. At 1 week post-MI, survivors (n=13) received GGF2 treatment (intravenous, biweekly for 4 weeks; n=8) or were untreated (n=5). At 5 weeks post-MI, fractional shortening was higher (32.8\% versus 25.3\%, P=0.019), and left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic dimension lower (4.5 versus 5.3 cm, P=0.003) in GGF2-treated animals. Treatment altered expression of 528 genes, as measured by microarrays, including collagens, basal lamina components, and matricellular proteins. GGF2-treated pigs exhibited improvements in LV cardiomyocyte mitochondria and intercalated disk structures and showed less fibrosis, altered matrix structure, and fewer myofibroblasts (myoFbs), based on trichrome staining, electron microscopy, and immunostaining. In vitro experiments with isolated murine and rat cardiac fibroblasts demonstrate that NRG-1Î² reduces myoFbs, and suppresses TGFÎ²-induced phospho-SMAD3 as well as Î±SMA expression. These results suggest that GGF2/NRG-1Î² prevents adverse remodeling after injury in part via anti-fibrotic effects in the heart.  2014 The Authors.

  note = {"CER is not a panacea, but it is a key to individualized care and innovation, not a threat. An initiative to advance our knowledge about the effectiveness of clinical strategies can hasten the day when personalized medicine transforms health care.... large observational databases and pooled trial results can be used to learn more about the subgroups of patients who benefit from therapy. A recent study showed that mortality was similar overall for patients with coronary disease whether treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary-artery bypass surgery. However, the results varied strikingly with age: mortality was much lower with surgery among patients 65 years of age or older and lower with PCI among those 55 years of age or younger. Such information is important not only for patients with varying risk characteristics and coexisting conditions but for women, members of minority groups, and others who have historically been underrepresented in clinical trials. Current CER efforts aim to ensure that much more useful data will be collected and that better methods will be developed for understanding differences in effectiveness among different patient groups. ... The greatest obstacle to the adoption of personalized approaches such as genomic testing, however, is the lack of adequately designed studies assessing their clinical utility. Often there is little consensus about the best way to design and implement such studies. We may know very little about how a test might improve health in typical clinical settings. These are precisely the kinds of issues that CER is designed to address. ... Genomic medicine, however, has had little impact to date in most areas of care -- a fact that some critics blame on payers, claiming that they impose unrealistically high evidence barriers before agreeing to pay for genomic tests. But payers have often championed personalized approaches -- for example, by reimbursing for KRAS testing before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has fully embraced it. The real bottleneck is often the science itself: progress in identifying clinically important genetic variants has been slow, since seldom does the presence of a common variant greatly increase the relative risk of a serious disease or of severe harm from treatment. Moreover, only some genomic tests provide clinically important information. For example, although the FDA endorsed the use of genomic tests to identify persons with warfarin sensitivity, comparative trials showed that the tests added little value over careful monitoring of the international normalized ratio. Chromosomal mutation 9p21.3 is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in women, but a recent study showed that knowledge of its presence adds no additional predictive power to the standard information on risk.

  abstract = {Concentrations of chemical constituents of precipitation are frequently expressed in terms of the precipitation-weighted mean, which has several desirable properties. Unfortunately, the weighted mean has no analytical analog of the standard error of the arithmetic mean for use in characterizing its statistical uncertainty. Several approximate expressions have been used previously in the literature, but there is no consensus as to which is best. This paper compares three methods from the literature with a standard based on bootstrapping. Comparative calculations were carried out for nine major ions measured at 222 sampling sites in the National Atmospheric Deposition/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN). The ratio variance approximation of Cochran (1977) gave results that were not statistically different from those of bootstrapping, and is suggested as the method of choice for routine computing of the standard error of the weighted mean. The bootstrap method has advantages of its own, including the fact that it is nonparametric, but requires additional effort and computation time.},

  abstract = {One motivation for estimating the standard error, SEMw, of a weighted mean concentration, Mw, of an ion in precipitation is to use it to compute a confidence interval for Mw. Typically this is done by multiplying the standard error by a factor that depends on the degree of confidence one wishes to express, on the assumption that the weighted mean has a normal distribution. This paper compares confidence intervals of Mw concentrations of ions in precipitation, as computed using the assumption of a normal distribution, with those estimated from distributions produced by bootstrapping. The hypothesis that Mw was normally distributed was rejected about half the time (at the 5\% significance level) in tests involving nine major ions measured at ten diverse sites in the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN). Most of these rejections occurred at sites with fewer than 100 samples, in agreement with previous results. Nevertheless, the hypothesis was often rejected at sites with more than 100 samples as well. The maximum error (relative to Mw) in the 95\% confidence limits made by assuming a normal distribution of the Mw at the ten sites examined was about 27\%. Most such errors were less than 10\%, and errors were smaller at sampling sites with {$>$} 100 samples than at those with {$<$} 100 samples.},

These models rely on marginal and conditional estimates of the instantaneous baseline hazard and provide estimates of the probabilities of an event of each severity for each recurrence over time.

  abstract = {Most clinical studies, which investigate the impact of therapy simultaneously, record the frequency of adverse events in order to monitor safety of the intervention. Study reports typically summarise adverse event data by tabulating the frequencies of the worst grade experienced but provide no details of the temporal profiles of specific types of adverse events. Such 'toxicity profiles' are potentially important tools in disease management and in the assessment of newer therapies including targeted treatments and immunotherapy where different types of toxicity may be more common at various times during long-term drug exposure. Toxicity profiles of commonly experienced adverse events occurring due to exposure to long-term treatment could assist in evaluating the costs of the health care benefits of therapy. We show how to generate toxicity profiles using an adaptation of the ordinal time-to-event model comprising of a two-step process, involving estimation of the multinomial response probabilities using multinomial logistic regression and combining these with recurrent time to event hazard estimates to produce cumulative event probabilities for each of the multinomial adverse event response categories. Such a model permits the simultaneous assessment of the risk of events over time and provides cumulative risk probabilities for each type of adverse event response. The method can be applied more generally by using different models to estimate outcome/response probabilities. The method is illustrated by developing toxicity profiles for three distinct types of adverse events associated with two treatment regimens for patients with advanced breast cancer.},

However, in a world in which measurements are noisy and effects are small, this will not work: selection on statistical significance leads to effect sizes which are overestimated and often in the wrong direction. After a brief discussion of two examples, one in economics and one in social psychology, we consider the procedural solution of open postpublication review, the design solution of devoting more effort to accurate measurements and within-person comparisons, and the statistical analysis solution of multilevel modeling and reporting all results rather than selection on significance. We argue that the current replication crisis in science arises in part from the ill effects of null hypothesis significance testing being used to study small effects with noisy data. In such settings, apparent success comes easy but truly replicable results require a more serious connection between theory, measurement, and data.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Statistical models can predict the absolute risk of an event such as cardiovascular death in the presence of competing risks such as death due to other causes. For personalized medicine and patient counseling, it is necessary to check that the model is calibrated in the sense that it provides reliable predictions for all subjects. There are three often encountered practical problems when the aim is to display or test if a risk prediction model is well calibrated. The first is lack of independent validation data, the second is right censoring, and the third is that when the risk scale is continuous, the estimation problem is as difficult as density estimation. To deal with these problems, we propose to estimate calibration curves for competing risks models based on jackknife pseudo-values that are combined with a nearest neighborhood smoother and a cross-validation approach to deal with all three problems.},

  abstract = {The availability of vast amounts of longitudinal data from electronic health records (EHR) and personal wearable devices opens the door to numerous new research questions. In many studies, individual variability of a longitudinal outcome is as important as the mean. Blood pressure fluctuations, glycemic variations, and mood swings are prime examples where it is critical to identify factors that affect the within-individual variability. We propose a scalable method, within-subject variance estimator by robust regression (WiSER), for the estimation and inference of the effects of both time-varying and time-invariant predictors on within-subject variance. It is robust against the misspecification of the conditional distribution of responses or the distribution of random effects. It shows similar performance as the correctly specified likelihood methods but is times faster. The estimation algorithm scales linearly in the total number of observations, making it applicable to massive longitudinal data sets. The effectiveness of WiSER is evaluated in extensive simulation studies. Its broad applicability is illustrated using the accelerometry data from the Women's Health Study and a clinical trial for longitudinal diabetes care.},

  abstract = {Summary The standard estimator for the cause-specific cumulative incidence function in a competing risks setting with left truncated and/or right censored data can be written in two alternative forms. One is a weighted empirical cumulative distribution function and the other a product-limit estimator. This equivalence suggests an alternative view of the analysis of time-to-event data with left truncation and right censoring: individuals who are still at risk or experienced an earlier competing event receive weights from the censoring and truncation mechanisms. As a consequence, inference on the cumulative scale can be performed using weighted versions of standard procedures. This holds for estimation of the cause-specific cumulative incidence function as well as for estimation of the regression parameters in the Fine and Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model. We show that, with the appropriate filtration, a martingale property holds that allows deriving asymptotic results for the proportional subdistribution hazards model in the same way as for the standard Cox proportional hazards model. Estimation of the cause-specific cumulative incidence function and regression on the subdistribution hazard can be performed using standard software for survival analysis if the software allows for inclusion of time-dependent weights. We show the implementation in the R statistical package. The proportional subdistribution hazards model is used to investigate the effect of calendar period as a deterministic external time varying covariate, which can be seen as a special case of left truncation, on AIDS related and non-AIDS related cumulative mortality.},

  abstract = {Clinicians are sometimes advised to make decisions using thresholds in measured variables, derived from prognostic studies. We studied why there are conflicting apparently-optimal prognostic thresholds, for example in exercise peak oxygen uptake (pVO2), ejection fraction (EF), and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) in heart failure (HF). Studies testing pVO2, EF or BNP prognostic thresholds in heart failure, published between 1990 and 2010, listed on Pubmed. First, we examined studies testing pVO2, EF or BNP prognostic thresholds. Second, we created repeated simulations of 1500 patients to identify whether an apparently-optimal prognostic threshold indicates step change in risk. 33 studies (8946 patients) tested a pVO2 threshold. 18 found it prognostically significant: the actual reported threshold ranged widely (10-18 ml/kg/min) but was overwhelmingly controlled by the individual study population's mean pVO2 (r = 0.86, p{$<$}0.00001). In contrast, the 15 negative publications were testing thresholds 199\% further from their means (p = 0.0001). Likewise, of 35 EF studies (10220 patients), the thresholds in the 22 positive reports were strongly determined by study means (r = 0.90, p{$<$}0.0001). Similarly, in the 19 positives of 20 BNP studies (9725 patients): r = 0.86 (p{$<$}0.0001). Second, survival simulations always discovered a "most significant" threshold, even when there was definitely no step change in mortality. With linear increase in risk, the apparently-optimal threshold was always near the sample mean (r = 0.99, p{$<$}0.001). This study cannot report the best threshold for any of these variables; instead it explains how common clinical research procedures routinely produce false thresholds. First, shifting (and/or disappearance) of an apparently-optimal prognostic threshold is strongly determined by studies' average pVO2, EF or BNP. Second, apparently-optimal thresholds always appear, even with no step in prognosis. Emphatic therapeutic guidance based on thresholds from observational studies may be ill-founded. We should not assume that optimal thresholds, or any thresholds, exist.},

Data were reentered for a sample of 44 patients by a data manager other than the one making the initial entry. The second entry was then compared with the first entry. The error rate for the two entries combined was 14 per 10,000 data items (fields) (95\% confidence interval 10, 19). The error rate for the initial entry alone was 15 per 10,000 fields (95\% confidence interval 9.5, 22), and the vital/important error rate (defined as any error on a principal outcome measure or a major error on any other endpoint or variable) was 2.5 per 10,000 fields (95\% confidence interval 0.68, 6.4).

  abstract = {Assessing per-protocol (PP) treatment efficacy on a time-to-event endpoint is a common objective of randomized clinical trials. The typical analysis uses the same method employed for the intention-to-treat analysis (e.g., standard survival analysis) applied to the subgroup meeting protocol adherence criteria. However, due to potential post-randomization selection bias, this analysis may mislead about treatment efficacy. Moreover, while there is extensive literature on methods for assessing causal treatment effects in compliers, these methods do not apply to a common class of trials where (a) the primary objective compares survival curves, (b) it is inconceivable to assign participants to be adherent and event free before adherence is measured, and (c) the exclusion restriction assumption fails to hold. HIV vaccine efficacy trials including the recent RV144 trial exemplify this class, because many primary endpoints (e.g., HIV infections) occur before adherence is measured, and nonadherent subjects who receive some of the planned immunizations may be partially protected. Therefore, we develop methods for assessing PP treatment efficacy for this problem class, considering three causal estimands of interest. Because these estimands are not identifiable from the observable data, we develop nonparametric bounds and semiparametric sensitivity analysis methods that yield estimated ignorance and uncertainty intervals. The methods are applied to RV144. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {In stepped cluster designs the intervention is introduced into some (or all) clusters at different times and persists until the end of the study. Instances include traditional parallel cluster designs and the more recent stepped-wedge designs. We consider the precision offered by such designs under mixed-effects models with fixed time and random subject and cluster effects (including interactions with time), and explore the optimal choice of uptake times. The results apply both to cross-sectional studies where new subjects are observed at each time-point, and longitudinal studies with repeat observations on the same subjects. The efficiency of the design is expressed in terms of a 'cluster-mean correlation' which carries information about the dependency-structure of the data, and two design coefficients which reflect the pattern of uptake-times. In cross-sectional studies the cluster-mean correlation combines information about the cluster-size and the intra-cluster correlation coefficient. A formula is given for the 'design effect' in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. An algorithm for optimising the choice of uptake times is described and specific results obtained for the best balanced stepped designs. In large studies we show that the best design is a hybrid mixture of parallel and stepped-wedge components, with the proportion of stepped wedge clusters equal to the cluster-mean correlation. The impact of prior uncertainty in the cluster-mean correlation is considered by simulation. Some specific hybrid designs are proposed for consideration when the cluster-mean correlation cannot be reliably estimated, using a minimax principle to ensure acceptable performance across the whole range of unknown values.  2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {Sightability models are binary logistic-regression models used to estimate and adjust for visibility bias in wildlife-population surveys. Like many models in wildlife and ecology, sightability models are typically developed from small observational datasets with many candidate predictors. Aggressive model-selection methods are often employed to choose a best model for prediction and effect estimation, despite evidence that such methods can lead to overfitting (i.e., selected models may describe random error or noise rather than true predictorâresponse curves) and poor predictive ability. We used moose (Alces alces) sightability data from northeastern Minnesota (2005â2007) as a case study to illustrate an alternative approach, which we refer to as degrees-of-freedom (df) spending: sample-size guidelines are used to determine an acceptable level of model complexity and then a pre-specified model is fit to the data and used for inference. For comparison, we also constructed sightability models using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) step-down procedures and model averaging (based on a small set of models developed using df-spending guidelines). We used bootstrap procedures to mimic the process of model fitting and prediction, and to compute an index of overfitting, expected predictive accuracy, and model-selection uncertainty. The index of overfitting increased 13\% when the number of candidate predictors was increased from three to eight and a best model was selected using step-down procedures. Likewise, model-selection uncertainty increased when the number of candidate predictors increased. Model averaging (based on R\,=\,30 models with 1â3 predictors) effectively shrunk regression coefficients toward zero and produced similar estimates of precision to our 3-df pre-specified model. As such, model averaging may help to guard against overfitting when too many predictors are considered (relative to available sample size). The set of candidate models will influence the extent to which coefficients are shrunk toward zero, which has implications for how one might apply model averaging to problems traditionally approached using variable-selection methods. We often recommend the df-spending approach in our consulting work because it is easy to implement and it naturally forces investigators to think carefully about their models and predictors. Nonetheless, similar concepts should apply whether one is fitting 1 model or using multi-model inference. For example, model-building decisions should consider the effective sample size, and potential predictors should be screened (without looking at their relationship to the response) for missing data, narrow distributions, collinearity, potentially overly influential observations, and measurement errors (e.g., via logical error checks).},

  abstract = {Scientists are often steered by common convention, funding agencies, and journal guidelines into a hypothesis-driven experimental framework, despite Isaac Newton's dictum that hypotheses have no place in experimental science. Some may think that Newton's cautionary note, which was in keeping with an experimental approach espoused by Francis Bacon, is inapplicable to current experimental method since, in accord with the philosopher Karl Popper, modern-day hypotheses are framed to serve as instruments of falsification, as opposed to verification. But Popper's "critical rationalist" framework too is problematic. It has been accused of being: inconsistent on philosophical grounds; unworkable for modern "large science," such as systems biology; inconsistent with the actual goals of experimental science, which is verification and not falsification; and harmful to the process of discovery as a practical matter. A criticism of the hypothesis as a framework for experimentation is offered. Presented is an alternative framework-the query/model approach-which many scientists may discover is the framework they are actually using, despite being required to give lip service to the hypothesis.},

  abstract = {The effective design and analysis of experiments in biology are critical to success, yet graduate students in biological and medical sciences typically receive very little formal training in these steps. With feedback from readers of the first edition, colleagues, and students taking the very popular experimental design courses taught by the author, this second edition of Experimental Design for Biologists retains the engaging writing style while organizing the book around the four elements of experimental design: the framework, the system, the experiment, and the model. The approach has been tested in the classroom, where the author has taught numerous graduate students, MD/PhD students, and postdoctoral fellows. The goal of every scientist is to discover something new and with the aid of Experimental Design for Biologists, this task is made a little easier.This handbook explains how to establish the framework for an experimental project, how to set up all of the components of an experimental system, design experiments within that system, determine and use the correct set of controls, and formulate models to test the veracity and resiliency of the data. This thoroughly updated edition of Experimental Design for Biologists is an essential source of theory and practical guidance for designing a research plan.},

  abstract = {Bayesian adaptive designs have gained popularity in all phases of clinical trials with numerous new developments in the past few decades. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to establish evidence for the effectiveness of vaccines, therapeutic treatments, and policies that could resolve or control the crisis emphasized the advantages offered by efficient and flexible clinical trial designs. In many COVID-19 clinical trials, because of the high level of uncertainty, Bayesian adaptive designs were considered advantageous. Designing Bayesian adaptive trials, however, requires extensive simulation studies that are generally considered challenging, particularly in time-sensitive settings such as a pandemic. In this article, we propose a set of methods for efficient estimation and uncertainty quantification for design operating characteristics of Bayesian adaptive trials. Specifically, we model the sampling distribution of Bayesian probability statements that are commonly used as the basis of decision making. To showcase the implementation and performance of the proposed approach, we use a clinical trial design with an ordinal disease-progression scale endpoint that was popular among COVID-19 trials. However, the proposed methodology may be applied generally in the clinical trial context where design operating characteristics cannot be obtained analytically.},

  abstract = {Monitoring binary outcomes when evaluating health care performance has recently become common. Classical statistical methodologies such as cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts have been refined and used for this purpose. For instance, the risk-adjusted CUSUM chart (RA-CUSUM) for monitoring binary outcomes was proposed for monitoring 30-day mortality following cardiac surgery. The RA-CUSUM inherits optimality properties of the original CUSUM charts in the sense of signaling early when there is change. However, although the RA-CUSUM is a powerful monitoring tool, it will always eventually signal a change with probability 1 even when there is no real change. In other words, the probability of a type I error for the RA-CUSUM is 1. It also turns out that, because of the skewed distribution of the run lengths of the RA-CUSUM, the median is often well below the mean, and as a consequence more than half of all its false alarms occur before the designed average run length. In addition, when the change to be detected occurs at a later time in the series of observations being monitored, the rate of false alarms increases, and the RA-CUSUM may not be appropriate. Therefore, if the price of false alarms is high, it is preferable to use methods that control the rate of false alarms. In this paper, we propose alternative sequential curtailed and risk-adjusted charts that control the type I error rate in the context of monitoring 30-day mortality following cardiac surgery. We explore the merits of each of these methodologies in terms of average run lengths as well as in terms of type I error probabilities, and we compare them to the RA-CUSUM chart. We illustrate the methodologies by using data on monitoring performance of seven surgeons from a medical center.},

  abstract = {Missing not at random (MNAR) data pose key challenges for statistical inference because the substantive model of interest is typically not identifiable without imposing further (eg, distributional) assumptions. Selection models have been routinely used for handling MNAR by jointly modeling the outcome and selection variables and typically assuming that these follow a bivariate normal distribution. Recent studies have advocated parametric selection approaches, for example, estimated by multiple imputation and maximum likelihood, that are more robust to departures from the normality assumption compared with those assuming that nonresponse and outcome are jointly normally distributed. However, the proposed methods have been mostly restricted to a specific joint distribution (eg, bivariate t-distribution). This paper discusses a flexible copula-based selection approach (which accommodates a wide range of non-Gaussian outcome distributions and offers great flexibility in the choice of functional form specifications for both the outcome and selection equations) and proposes a flexible imputation procedure that generates plausible imputed values from the copula selection model. A simulation study characterizes the relative performance of the copula model compared with the most commonly used selection models for estimating average treatment effects with MNAR data. We illustrate the methods in the REFLUX study, which evaluates the effect of laparoscopic surgery on long-term quality of life in patients with reflux disease. We provide software code for implementing the proposed copula framework using the R package GJRM.},

For this reason it is asymptotically unbiased, unlike Harrell's c-index based on informative pairs.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) has emerged as an alternative to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for the treatment of cervical pathologies. Studies are on-going to assess the long term outcomes of CDA. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of the Prestige(Â®) LP Disc at 84-months follow up. METHODS: Prospective data from 280 CDA patients with single-level cervical disc disease with radiculopathy or myelopathy were compared with 265 historical control ACDF patients. Clinical and radiographic follow up was completed pre-operatively, intraoperatively, and at intervals up to 84 months. RESULTS: Follow-up rate was 75.9\% for CDA and 70.0\% for ACDF patients. Statistical improvements (p {$<$} 0.001) in Neck Disability Index (NDI), neck/arm pain, and SF-36 were achieved by 1.5 months in both groups and maintained through 84 months. At 84 months, 86.1\% of CDA versus 80.1\% of ACDF patients achieved NDI success, (â¥15-point improvement over baseline). Mean NDI score improvements exceeded 30 points in both groups. SF-36 PCS/MCS mean improvements were 13.1Â±11.9/8.2Â±12.3 points for CDA and 10.7Â±11.8/8.3Â±13.6 points for ACDF. Neurological success was 92.8\% for CDA and 79.7\% for ACDF patients. The rate of Overall Success was 74.9\% for CDA and 63.2\% for ACDF. At 84 months, 17.5\% of CDA and 16.6\% of ACDF patients had a possibly implant- or implant-surgical procedure-related adverse event. Eighteen (6.4\%) CDA and 29 (10.9\%) ACDF patients had a second surgery at the index level. In CDA patients, mean angular motion at the target level was maintained at 24 (7.5Â°) and 84 (6.9Â°) months. Bridging bone was reported in 5.9\%/9.5\%/10.2\%/13.0\% of CDA patients at 24/36/60/84 months. Change in mean preoperative angulation of the adjacent segment above/below the index level was1.06Â±4.39/1.25Â±4.06 for CDA and (-0.23)Â±5.37/1.25Â±5.07 for ACDF patients. At 84 months, 90.9\% of CDA and 85.6\% of ACDF patients were satisfied with the results of their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Prestige LP maintained significantly improved clinical outcomes and segmental motion; statistical superiority of CDA was concluded for overall success. This investigational device exemption study was sponsored by Medtronic Spinal and Biologics, Memphis, TN. Study approved by the Hughston Sports Medicine Center Institutional Review Board on January 7, 2005. Clinical trial registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00667459.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The authors compared the efficacy and safety of arthroplasty using the Prestige LP cervical disc with those of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for the treatment of degenerative disc disease (DDD) at 2 adjacent levels. METHODS Patients from 30 investigational sites were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: investigational patients (209) underwent arthroplasty using a Prestige LP artificial disc, and control patients (188) underwent ACDF with a cortical ring allograft and anterior cervical plate. Patients were evaluated preoperatively, intraoperatively, and at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Efficacy and safety outcomes were measured according to the Neck Disability Index (NDI), Numeric Rating Scales for neck and arm pain, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), gait abnormality, disc height, range of motion (investigational) or fusion (control), adverse events (AEs), additional surgeries, and neurological status. Treatment was considered an overall success when all 4 of the following criteria were met: 1) NDI score improvement of â¥ 15 points over the preoperative score, 2) maintenance or improvement in neurological status compared with preoperatively, 3) no serious AE caused by the implant or by the implant and surgical procedure, and 4) no additional surgery (supplemental fixation, revision, or nonelective implant removal). Independent statisticians performed Bayesian statistical analyses. RESULTS The 24-month rates of overall success were 81.4\% for the investigational group and 69.4\% for the control group. The posterior mean for overall success in the investigational group exceeded that in the control group by 0.112 (95\% highest posterior density interval = 0.023 to 0.201) with a posterior probability of 1 for noninferiority and 0.993 for superiority, demonstrating the superiority of the investigational group for overall success. Noninferiority of the investigational group was demonstrated for all individual components of overall success and individual effectiveness end points, except for the SF-36 Mental Component Summary. The investigational group was superior to the control group for NDI success. The proportion of patients experiencing any AE was 93.3\% (195/209) in the investigational group and 92.0\% (173/188) in the control group, which were not statistically different. The rate of patients who reported any serious AE (Grade 3 or 4) was significantly higher in the control group (90 [47.9\%] of 188) than in the investigational group (72 [34.4\%] of 209) with a posterior probability of superiority of 0.996. Radiographic success was achieved in 51.0\% (100/196) of the investigational patients (maintenance of motion without evidence of bridging bone) and 82.1\% (119/145) of the control patients (fusion). At 24 months, heterotopic ossification was identified in 27.8\% (55/198) of the superior levels and 36.4\% (72/198) of the inferior levels of investigational patients. CONCLUSIONS Arthroplasty with the Prestige LP cervical disc is as effective and safe as ACDF for the treatment of cervical DDD at 2 contiguous levels and is an alternative treatment for intractable radiculopathy or myelopathy at 2 adjacent levels.

  abstract = {Two popular approaches for relating correlated measurements of a non-Gaussian response variable to a set of predictors are to fit a marginal model using generalized estimating equations and to fit a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) by introducing latent random variables. The first approach is effective for parameter estimation, but leaves one without a formal model for the data with which to assess quality of fit or make individual-level predictions for future observations. The second approach overcomes these deficiencies, but leads to parameter estimates that must be interpreted conditional on the latent variables. To obtain marginal summaries, one needs to evaluate an analytically intractable integral or use attenuation factors as an approximation. Further, we note an unpalatable implication of the standard GLMM. To resolve these issues, we turn to a class of marginally interpretable GLMMs that lead to parameter estimates with a marginal interpretation while maintaining the desirable statistical properties of a conditionally specified model and avoiding problematic implications. We establish the form of these models under the most commonly used link functions and address computational issues. For logistic mixed effects models, we introduce an accurate and efficient method for evaluating the logistic-normal integral.},

  abstract = {An emerging concern with new therapeutic agents, especially treatments for type 2 diabetes, a prevalent condition that increases an individual's risk of heart attack or stroke, is the likelihood of adverse events, especially cardiovascular events, that the new agents may cause. These concerns have led to regulatory requirements for demonstrating that a new agent increases the risk of an adverse event relative to a control by no more than, say, 30\% or 80\% with high (e.g., 97.5\%) confidence. We describe a Bayesian adaptive procedure for determining if the sample size for a development program needs to be increased and, if necessary, by how much, to provide the required assurance of limited risk. The decision is based on the predictive likelihood of a sufficiently high posterior probability that the relative risk is no more than a specified bound. Allowance can be made for between-center as well as within-center variability to accommodate large-scale developmental programs, and design alternatives (e.g., many small centers, few large centers) for obtaining additional data if needed can be explored. Binomial or Poisson likelihoods can be used, and center-level covariates can be accommodated. The predictive likelihoods are explored under various conditions to assess the statistical properties of the method.},

In theory, MI and FIML are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with MI, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before MI and FIML are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. MI theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information (gamma) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test MI models across several scenarios in which gamma and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using MI should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. These recommendations are based on gamma, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to FIML) due to using too few imputations.},

  abstract = {A requirement for calculating sample sizes for cluster randomized trials (CRTs) conducted over multiple periods of time is the specification of a form for the correlation between outcomes of subjects within the same cluster, encoded via the within-cluster correlation structure. Previously proposed within-cluster correlation structures have made strong assumptions; for example, the usual assumption is that correlations between the outcomes of all pairs of subjects are identical (âuniform correlationâ). More recently, structures that allow for a decay in correlation between pairs of outcomes measured in different periods have been suggested. However, these structures are overly simple in settings with continuous recruitment and measurement. We propose a more realistic âcontinuous-time correlation decayâ structure whereby correlations between subjects' outcomes decay as the time between these subjects' measurement times increases. We investigate the use of this structure on trial planning in the context of a primary care diabetes trial, where there is evidence of decaying correlation between pairs of patients' outcomes over time. In particular, for a range of different trial designs, we derive the variance of the treatment effect estimator under continuous-time correlation decay and compare this to the variance obtained under uniform correlation. For stepped wedge and cluster randomized crossover designs, incorrectly assuming uniform correlation will underestimate the required sample size under most trial configurations likely to occur in practice. Planning of CRTs requires consideration of the most appropriate within-cluster correlation structure to obtain a suitable sample size.},

  abstract = {Overcoming bias due to confounding and missing data is challenging when analyzing observational data. Propensity scores are commonly used to account for the first problem and multiple imputation for the latter. Unfortunately, it is not known how best to proceed when both techniques are required. We investigate whether two different approaches to combining propensity scores and multiple imputation (Across and Within) lead to differences in the accuracy or precision of exposure effect estimates. Both approaches start by imputing missing values multiple times. Propensity scores are then estimated for each resulting dataset. Using the Across approach, the mean propensity score across imputations for each subject is used in a single subsequent analysis. Alternatively, the Within approach uses propensity scores individually to obtain exposure effect estimates in each imputation, which are combined to produce an overall estimate. These approaches were compared in a series of Monte Carlo simulations and applied to data from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register. Results indicated that the Within approach produced unbiased estimates with appropriate confidence intervals, whereas the Across approach produced biased results and unrealistic confidence intervals. Researchers are encouraged to implement the Within approach when conducting propensity score analyses with incomplete data.},

  abstract = {Trial planning requires making efficient yet practical design choices. In a cluster randomized crossover trial, clusters of subjects cross back and forth between implementing the control and intervention conditions over the course of the trial, with each crossover marking the start of a new period. If it is possible to set up such a trial with more crossovers, a pertinent question is whether there are efficiency gains from clusters crossing over more frequently, and if these gains are substantial enough to justify the added complexity and cost of implementing more crossovers. We seek to determine the optimal number of crossovers for a fixed trial duration, and then identify other highly efficient designs by allowing the total number of clusters to vary and imposing thresholds on maximum cost and minimum statistical power. Our results pertain to trials with continuous recruitment and a continuous primary outcome, with the treatment effect estimated using a linear mixed model. To account for the similarity between subjects' outcomes within a cluster, we assume a correlation structure in which the correlation decays gradually in a continuous manner as the time between subjects' measurements increases. The optimal design is characterized by crossovers between the control and intervention conditions with each successive subject. However, this design is neither practical nor cost-efficient to implement, nor is it necessary: the gains in efficiency increase sharply in moving from a two-period to a four-period trial design, but approach an asymptote for the scenarios considered as the number of crossovers continues to increase.},

In acute diseases such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), even well conducted prospective studies may suffer from missing data in baseline characteristics and outcomes. Statistical models may simply drop patients with any missing values, potentially leaving a selected subset of the original cohort. Imputation is widely accepted by methodologists as an appropriate way to deal with missing data. We aim to provide practical guidance on handling missing data for prediction modelling. We hereto propose a five-step approach, centred around single and multiple imputation: 1) explore the missing data patterns; 2) choose a method of imputation; 3) perform imputation; 4) assess diagnostics of the imputation; and 5) analyse the imputed datasets. We illustrate these 5 steps with the estimation and validation of the IMPACT prognostic model in 1375 patients from the CENTER-TBI database, included in 53 centers across 17 countries, with moderate or severe TBI in the prospective European CENTER-TBI study. Future prediction modelling studies in acute diseases may benefit from following the suggested 5 steps for optimal statistical analysis and interpretation, after maximal effort have been made to minimize missing data.},

It then discusses several properties of P-values that have been presented as fatal flaws: That P-values exhibit extreme variation across samples (and thus are âunreliableâ), confound effect size with sample size, are sensitive to sample size, and depend on investigator sampling intentions. These properties are often criticized from a likelihood or Bayesian framework, yet they are exactly the properties P-values should exhibit when they are constructed and interpreted correctly within their originating framework. Other common criticisms are that P-values force users to focus on irrelevant hypotheses and overstate evidence against those hypotheses. These problems are not however properties of P-values but are faults of researchers who focus on null hypotheses and overstate evidence based on misperceptions that p = 0.05 represents enough evidence to reject hypotheses. Those problems are easily seen without use of Bayesian concepts by translating the observed P-value p into the Shannon information (S-value or surprisal) âlog2(p).},

  abstract = {Statistical science (as opposed to mathematical statistics) involves far more than probability theory, for it requires realistic causal models of data generators - even for purely descriptive goals. Statistical decision theory requires more causality: Rational decisions are actions taken to minimize costs while maximizing benefits, and thus require explication of causes of loss and gain. Competent statistical practice thus integrates logic, context, and probability into scientific inference and decision using narratives filled with causality. This reality was seen and accounted for intuitively by the founders of modern statistics, but was not well recognized in the ensuing statistical theory (which focused instead on the causally inert properties of probability measures). Nonetheless, both statistical foundations and basic statistics can and should be taught using formal causal models. The causal view of statistical science fits within a broader information-processing framework which illuminates and unifies frequentist, Bayesian, and related probability-based foundations of statistics. Causality theory can thus be seen as a key component connecting computation to contextual information, not extra-statistical but instead essential for sound statistical training and applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract Despite publication of many wellâargued critiques of null hypothesis testing (NHT). behavioral science researchers continue to rely heavily on this set of practices. Although we agree with most critics' catalogs of NHT's flaws, this article also takes the unusual stance of identifying virtues that may explain why NHT continues to he so extensively used. These virtues include providing results in the form of a dichotomous (yes/no) hypothesis evaluation and providing an index (p value) Mini has a justifiable mapping onto confidence in repeatability of a null hypothesis rejection. The mostâcriticized flaws of NHT can be avoided when the importance of a hypothesis, rather than the p value of its test, is used to determine that a finding is worthy of report, and when p=.05 is treated as insufficient basis for confidence in the replicability of an isolated nonânull finding. Together with many recent critics of NHT, we also urge reporting of important hypothesis tests in enough descriptive detail to permit secondary uses such as metaâanalysis.},

We evaluated change scores, analyses of covariance including linear, nonlinear with/without robust variance estimations, before and after optimal matching. We also evaluated the impact of measurement error. With increasing HbA1c baseline differences between groups, bias in effect estimates and suboptimal CI coverage probabilities increased in all approaches. These issues were further compounded by measurement error. Matching on baseline HbA1c, substantially mitigated these issues.

In the standard approach, if the null hypothesis of equal carryover effects is not rejected, data from both periods are used to estimate and test for treatment differences; if the null hypothesis is rejected, data from the first period alone are used. A Bayesian analysis based on the Bayes factor against unequal carryover effects is given. Although this Bayesian approach avoids the "all-or-nothing" decision inherent in the standard approach, it recognizes that with small trials it is difficult to provide unequivocal evidence that the carryover effects of the two treatments are equal, and thus that the interpretation of the difference between treatment effects is highly dependent on a subjective assessment of the reality or not of equal carryover effects.},

  abstract = {Although missing outcome data are an important problem in randomized trials and observational studies, methods to address this issue can be difficult to apply. Using simulated data, the authors compared 3 methods to handle missing outcome data: 1) complete case analysis; 2) single imputation; and 3) multiple imputation (all 3 with and without covariate adjustment). Simulated scenarios focused on continuous or dichotomous missing outcome data from randomized trials or observational studies. When outcomes were missing at random, single and multiple imputations yielded unbiased estimates after covariate adjustment. Estimates obtained by complete case analysis with covariate adjustment were unbiased as well, with coverage close to 95\%. When outcome data were missing not at random, all methods gave biased estimates, but handling missing outcome data by means of 1 of the 3 methods reduced bias compared with a complete case analysis without covariate adjustment. Complete case analysis with covariate adjustment and multiple imputation yield similar estimates in the event of missing outcome data, as long as the same predictors of missingness are included. Hence, complete case analysis with covariate adjustment can and should be used as the analysis of choice more often. Multiple imputation, in addition, can accommodate the missing-not-at-random scenario more flexibly, making it especially suited for sensitivity analyses.},

The goal of our analysis was to fit a logistic model that relates the expected value of the outcomes with explanatory variables that are measured on each subject. However, additional care must be taken to adjust for the association between the repeated measurements on each subject. We propose a new maximum likelihood method for covariates that may be fixed or time varying. We also implement and make comparisons with two other approaches: generalized estimating equations, which may be more robust to misspecification of the true correlation structure, and alternating logistic regression, which models association via odds ratios that are subject to less restrictive constraints than are correlations. The proposed estimation procedure will yield consistent and asymptotically normal estimates of the regression and correlation parameters if the correlation on consecutive measurements on a subject is correctly specified. Simulations demonstrate that our approach can yield improved efficiency in estimation of the regression parameter; for equally spaced and complete data, the gains in efficiency were greatest for the parameter associated with a time-by-group interaction term and for stronger values of the correlation. For unequally spaced data and with dropout according to a missing-at-random mechanism, MARK1ML with correctly specified consecutive correlations yielded substantial improvements in terms of both bias and efficiency. We present an analysis to demonstrate application of the methods we consider. We also offer an R function for easy implementation of our approach.},

  abstract = {The recurrent BRAF driver mutation V600E (BRAF (V600E)) is currently one of the most clinically relevant mutations in melanoma. However, the genome-wide transcriptional and epigenetic dysregulations induced by BRAF (V600E) are still unclear. The investigation of this driver mutation's functional consequences is critical to the understanding of tumorigenesis and the development of therapeutic strategies. We performed an integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic changes disturbed by BRAF (V600E) by comparing the gene expression and methylation profiles of 34 primary cutaneous melanoma tumors harboring BRAF (V600E) with those of 27 BRAF (WT) samples available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A total of 711 significantly differentially expressed genes were identified as putative BRAF (V600E) target genes. Functional enrichment analyses revealed the transcription factor MITF (p\,{$<$}\,3.6 Ã 10(-16)) and growth factor TGFB1 (p\,{$<$}\,3.1 Ã 10(-9)) were the most significantly enriched up-regulators, with MITF being significantly up-regulated, whereas TGFB1 was significantly down-regulated in BRAF (V600E), suggesting that they may mediate tumorigenesis driven by BRAF (V600E). Further investigation using the MITF ChIP-Seq data confirmed that BRAF (V600E) led to an overall increased level of gene expression for the MITF targets. Furthermore, DNA methylation analysis revealed a global DNA methylation loss in BRAF (V600E) relative to BRAF (WT). This might be due to BRAF dysregulation of DNMT3A, which was identified as a potential target with significant down-regulation in BRAF (V600E). Finally, we demonstrated that BRAF (V600E) targets may play essential functional roles in cell growth and proliferation, measured by their effects on melanoma tumor growth using a short hairpin RNA silencing experimental dataset. Our integrative analysis identified a set of BRAF (V600E) target genes. Further analyses suggested a complex mechanism driven by mutation BRAF (V600E) on melanoma tumorigenesis that disturbs specific cancer-related genes, pathways, and methylation modifications.},

  abstract = {Analysis of a large longitudinal study of children motivated our work. The results illustrate how accurate inference for fixed effects in a general linear mixed model depends on the covariance model selected for the data. Simulation studies have revealed biased inference for the fixed effects with an underspecified covariance structure, at least in small samples. One underspecification common for longitudinal data assumes a simple random intercept and conditional independence of the within-subject errors (i.e., compound symmetry). We prove that the underspecification creates bias in both small and large samples, indicating that recruiting more participants will not alleviate inflation of the Type I error rate associated with fixed effect inference. Enumerations and simulations help quantify the bias and evaluate strategies for avoiding it. When practical, backwards selection of the covariance model, starting with an unstructured pattern, provides the best protection. Tutorial papers can guide the reader in minimizing the chances of falling into the often spurious software trap of nonconvergence. In some cases, the logic of the study design and the scientific context may support a structured pattern, such as an autoregressive structure. The sandwich estimator provides a valid alternative in sufficiently large samples. Authors reporting mixed-model analyses should note possible biases in fixed effects inference because of the following: (i) the covariance model selection process; (ii) the specific covariance model chosen; or (iii) the test approximation.},

In the US, there are approximately 780 000 CD patients and 33 000 new cases added each year. In this article, we propose a new network meta-regression approach for modeling ordinal outcomes in order to assess the efficacy of treatments for CD. Specifically, we develop regression models based on aggregate covariates for the underlying cut points of the ordinal outcomes as well as for the variances of the random effects to capture heterogeneity across trials. Our proposed models are particularly useful for indirect comparisons of multiple treatments that have not been compared head-to-head within the network meta-analysis framework. Moreover, we introduce Pearson residuals and construct an invariant test statistic to evaluate goodness-of-fit in the setting of ordinal outcome data. A detailed case study demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed methodology is carried out using aggregate ordinal outcome data from 16 clinical trials for treating CD.},

  abstract = {The use of propensity score methods to adjust for selection bias in observational studies has become increasingly popular in public health and medical research. A substantial portion of studies using propensity score adjustment treat the propensity score as a conventional regression predictor. Through a Monte Carlo simulation study, Austin and colleagues. investigated the bias associated with treatment effect estimation when the propensity score is used as a covariate in nonlinear regression models, such as logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. We show that the bias exists even in a linear regression model when the estimated propensity score is used and derive the explicit form of the bias. We also conduct an extensive simulation study to compare the performance of such covariate adjustment with propensity score stratification, propensity score matching, inverse probability of treatment weighted method, and nonparametric functional estimation using splines. The simulation scenarios are designed to reflect real data analysis practice. Instead of specifying a known parametric propensity score model, we generate the data by considering various degrees of overlap of the covariate distributions between treated and control groups. Propensity score matching excels when the treated group is contained within a larger control pool, while the model-based adjustment may have an edge when treated and control groups do not have too much overlap. Overall, adjusting for the propensity score through stratification or matching followed by regression or using splines, appears to be a good practical strategy.},

  abstract = {There are several steps to confirming the safety and efficacy of a new medicine. A sequence of trials, each with its own objectives, is usually required. Quantitative risk metrics can be useful for informing decisions about whether a medicine should transition from one stage of development to the next. To obtain an estimate of the probability of regulatory approval, pharmaceutical companies may start with industry-wide success rates and then apply to these subjective adjustments to reflect program-specific information. However, this approach lacks transparency and fails to make full use of data from previous clinical trials. We describe a quantitative Bayesian approach for calculating the probability of success (PoS) at the end of phase II which incorporates internal clinical data from one or more phase IIb studies, industry-wide success rates, and expert opinion or external data if needed. Using an example, we illustrate how PoS can be calculated accounting for differences between the phase II data and future phase III trials, and discuss how the methods can be extended to accommodate accelerated drug development pathways.},

  abstract = {In a celebrated 1996 article, Schervish showed that, for testing interval null hypotheses, tests typically viewed as optimal can be logically incoherent. Specifically, one may fail to reject a specific interval null, but neverthelessâtesting at the same level with the same dataâreject a larger null, in which the original one is nested. This result has been used to argue against the widespread practice of viewing p-values as measures of evidence. In the current work we approach tests of interval nulls using simple Bayesian decision theory, and establish straightforward conditions that ensure coherence in Schervishâs sense. From these, we go on to establish novel frequentist criteriaâdifferent to Type I error rateâthat, when controlled at fixed levels, give tests that are coherent in Schervishâs sense. The results suggest that exploring frequentist properties beyond the familiar NeymanâPearson framework may ameliorate some of statistical testingâs well-known problems.},

Most methods assume very specific models or types of data to simplify calculations (eg, ordered categorical or metric data, location shift alternatives, etc). We present a unified approach that covers metric data with and without ties, count data, ordered categorical data, and even dichotomous data. For that, we calculate the unknown theoretical quantities such as the variances under the null and relevant alternative hypothesis by considering the following âsynthetic dataâ approach. We evaluate data whose empirical distribution functions match the theoretical distribution functions involved in the computations of the unknown theoretical quantities. Then, well-known relations for the ranks of the data are used for the calculations. In addition to computing the necessary sample size N for a fixed allocation proportion t = n1/N, where n1 is the sample size in the first group and N = n1 + n2 is the total sample size, we provide an interval for the optimal allocation rate t, which minimizes the total sample size N. It turns out that, for certain distributions, a balanced design is optimal. We give a characterization of such distributions. Furthermore, we show that the optimal choice of t depends on the ratio of the two variances, which determine the variance of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic under the alternative.

MI yields valid inferences not only in congenial settings, but also in certain uncongenial ones as well---where the imputer's model (1) is more general (i.e. makes fewer assumptions) than the complete-data estimation method, or when the imputer's model makes additional assumptions that are well-founded."}

  abstract = {Objectives Predictive risk models are advocated in psychosocial oncology practice to provide timely and appropriate support to those likely to experience the emotional and psychological consequences of cancer and its treatments. New digital technologies mean that large scale and routine data collection are becoming part of everyday clinical practice. Using these data to try to identify those at greatest risk for late psychosocial effects of cancer is an attractive proposition in a climate of unmet need and limited resource. In this paper, we present a framework to support the development of high-quality predictive risk models in psychosocial and supportive oncology. The aim is to provide awareness and increase accessibility of best practice literature to support researchers in psychosocial and supportive care to undertake a structured evidence-based approach. Data Sources Statistical prediction risk model publications. Conclusion In statistical modeling and data science different approaches are needed if the goal is to predict rather than explain. The deployment of a poorly developed and tested predictive risk model has the potential to do great harm. Recommendations for best practice to develop predictive risk models have been developed but there appears to be little application within psychosocial and supportive oncology care. Implications for Nursing Practice Use of best practice evidence will ensure the development and validation of predictive models that are robust as these are currently lacking. These models have the potential to enhance supportive oncology care through harnessing routine digital collection of patient-reported outcomes and the targeting of interventions according to risk characteristics.},

  abstract = {The problem considered is that of making inferences about the value of a parameter vector Î¸ based on the value of an observable random vector y that is subject to selection of the form y â S (for a known subset S). According to conventional wisdom, a Bayesian approach (unlike a frequentist approach) requires no adjustment for selection, which is generally regarded as counterintuitive and even paradoxical. An alternative considered herein consists (when taking a Bayesian approach in the face of selection) of basing the inferences for the value of Î¸ on the posterior distribution derived from the conditional (on y â S ) joint distribution of y and Î¸ . That leads to an adjustment in the likelihood function that is reinterpretable as an adjustment to the prior distribution and ultimately leads to a different posterior distribution. And it serves to make the inferences specific to settings that are subject to selection of the same kind as the setting that gave rise to the data. Moreover, even in the absence of any real selection, this approach can be used to make the inferences specific to a meaningful subset of y-values.},

  abstract = {Many clinical research studies evaluate a time-to-event outcome, illustrate survival functions, and conventionally report estimated hazard ratios to express the magnitude of the treatment effect when comparing between groups. However, it may not be straightforward to interpret the hazard ratio clinically and statistically when the proportional hazards assumption is invalid. In some recent papers published in clinical journals, the use of restricted mean survival time (RMST) or Ï-year mean survival time is discussed as one of the alternative summary measures for the time-to-event outcome. The RMST is defined as the expected value of time to event limited to a specific time point corresponding to the area under the survival curve up to the specific time point. This article summarizes the necessary information to conduct statistical analysis using the RMST, including the definition and statistical properties of the RMST, adjusted analysis methods, sample size calculation, information fraction for the RMST difference, and clinical and statistical meaning and interpretation. Additionally, we discuss how to set the specific time point to define the RMST from two main points of view. We also provide developed SAS codes to determine the sample size required to detect an expected RMST difference with appropriate power and reconstruct individual survival data to estimate an RMST reference value from a reported survival curve.},

Gail has noted this previously [ENAR Presidential Invited Address, April 1990], arguing that one goal of a clinical trial ought to be to predict the direction and size of a treatment benefit for a patient with specific covariate values. In contrast, population-averaged estimates of treatment effect compare outcomes in groups of patients. The groups being compared are determined by whatever covariates are included in the model. The treatment effect is then a comparison of average outcomes, where the averaging is over all omitted covariates."}

To assess the adequacy of imputation models, we can compare completed data with their replicates simulated under the imputation model. We apply analyses of substantive interest to both datasets and use posterior predictive checks of the differences of these estimates to quantify the evidence of model inadequacy. We can further integrate out the imputed missing data and their replicates over the completed-data analyses to reduce variance in the comparison. In many cases, the checking procedure can be easily implemented using standard imputation software by treating re-imputations under the model as posterior predictive replicates. Thus, it can be applied for non-Bayesian imputation methods. We also sketch several strategies for applying the method in the context of practical imputation analyses. We illustrate the method using two real data applications and study its property using a simulation.},

Hospitals, as one type of provider, are often classified into quality tiers (e.g., top or suboptimal) based on their performance data for various purposes. However, potential misclassification might lead to detrimental effects for both consumers and payers. Although such risk has been highlighted by applied health services researchers, a systematic investigation of statistical approaches has been lacking. We assess and compare the expected accuracy of several commonly used classification methods: unadjusted hospital-level averages, shrinkage estimators under a random-effects model accommodating between-hospital variation, and two others based on posterior probabilities. Assuming that performance data follow a classic one-way random-effects model with unequal sample size per hospital, we derive accuracy formulae for these classification approaches and gain insight into how the misclassification might be affected by various factors such as reliability of the data, hospital-level sample size distribution, and cutoff values between quality tiers. The case of binary performance data is also explored using Monte Carlo simulation strategies. We apply the methods to real data and discuss the practical implications.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a popular nonparametric tree ensemble procedure with broad applications to data analysis. While its widespread popularity stems from its prediction performance, an equally important feature is that it provides a fully nonparametric measure of variable importance (VIMP). A current limitation of VIMP, however, is that no systematic method exists for estimating its variance. As a solution, we propose a subsampling approach that can be used to estimate the variance of VIMP and for constructing confidence intervals. The method is general enough that it can be applied to many useful settings, including regression, classification, and survival problems. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the subsampling estimator and in particular find that the deleteâd jackknife variance estimator, a close cousin, is especially effective under low subsampling rates due to its bias correction properties. These 2 estimators are highly competitive when compared with the .164 bootstrap estimator, a modified bootstrap procedure designed to deal with ties in outâofâsample data. Most importantly, subsampling is computationally fast, thus making it especially attractive for big data settings.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Many treatments are adopted into clinical practice without a solid evidence base and might be used heterogeneously across settings. Rigorous randomised controlled trials are therefore needed to inform decisions about the comparative effectiveness of treatments in common use. The mainstay of comparative effectiveness research is pragmatic trial design, which emphasises broad eligibility criteria, simple logistics, routinely collected outcome data, and cost efficient designs. Although treatment differences at the individual level might be small, they can become important when aggregated across large populations. To detect these small differences, very large trials are often required. In multiple period, cluster randomised, crossover trials, the study design randomises clusters (eg, hospitals) to exposure to different interventions in a randomly determined order, and is an attractive design for comparative effectiveness research. The trial design can be highly statistically efficient, compared with other competing designs, and can have many logistical advantages. Several prominent examples of this trial design have been published recently, yet practical guidance is lacking on how best to design these trials to ensure that they provide robust evidence. Some considerations include how to determine the frequency and number of crossovers, the importance of a time balanced design, how to determine the required sample size, and how to analyse appropriately. The justification for using this design (over a design randomising on the level of individual patients) also raises ethical concerns when used to evaluate individual level interventions without the prospective informed consent of individual participants. In this article, we outline the key methodological and ethical requirements needed for the robust design of multiple period, cluster randomised, crossover trials.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Simple descriptive listings and inference statistics based on 2Ã2 tables are still the most common way of summarizing and reporting adverse events data from randomized controlled trials, although these methods do not account for differences in observation times between treatment groups. Using standard methods from survival analysis such as the Cox model or KaplanâMeier estimates would overcome this problem but limit the analysis to the first safety-related event of each subject. As an alternative, we discuss two models for recurrent events dataâthe AndersenâGill and PrenticeâWilliamsâPeterson modelâregarding their applicability to safety data from randomized controlled trials. We argue that these models can be used to estimate two different quantities: a direct treatment effect on the risk of an event (PrenticeâWilliamsâPeterson) and a total treatment effect as sum of the direct effect and the treatment's indirect effect via the event history (AndersonâGill). Using simulated data, we illustrate the difference between these treatment effects and analyze the performance of both models in different scenarios. Because both models are limited to the analysis of cause-specific hazards if competing risks are present, we suggest to incorporate estimates of the mean frequency of events in the analysis to additionally allow the comparison of treatment effects on absolute event probabilities. We demonstrate the application of both models and the mean frequency function to safety endpoints with an illustrative analysis of data from a randomized phase-III study.

  abstract = {We evaluated the effects of various strategies of covariate adjustment on type I error, power, and potential reduction in sample size in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with time-to-event outcomes. We used Cox models in simulated data sets with different treatment effects (hazard ratios [HRs] = 1, 1.4, and 1.7), covariate effects (HRs = 1, 2, and 5), covariate prevalences (10\% and 50\%), and censoring levels (no, low, and high). Treatment and a single covariate were dichotomous. We examined the sample size that gives the same power as an unadjusted analysis for three strategies: prespecified, significant predictive, and significant imbalance. Type I error generally was at the nominal level. The power to detect a true treatment effect was greater with adjusted than unadjusted analyses, especially with prespecified and significant-predictive strategies. Potential reductions in sample size with a covariate HR between 2 and 5 were between 15\% and 44\% (covariate prevalence 50\%) and between 4\% and 12\% (covariate prevalence 10\%). The significant-imbalance strategy yielded small reductions. The reduction was greater with stronger covariate effects, but was independent of treatment effect, sample size, and censoring level. Adjustment for one predictive baseline characteristic yields greater power to detect a true treatment effect than unadjusted analysis, without inflation of type I error and with potentially moderate reductions in sample size. Analysis of RCTs with time-to-event outcomes should adjust for predictive covariates.},

  abstract = {Objective Insecure hiding of the treatment allocation in randomized trials is associated with bias. It is less certain how much bias is associated with different methods of treatment allocation.  Study Design and Setting  Meta-epidemiological study of 389 randomized trials from 19 systematic reviews and 65 meta-analyses with differing methods of treatment allocation. Pooled ratios of odds ratios (RORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were calculated from trials with different methods of treatment allocation. An ROR less than one shows exaggeration of treatment effect.  Results  There is no evidence that the use of sealed envelopes with enhancement was different from central randomization (ROR 1.02, 95\% CI: 0.85â1.23). Sealed envelopes without enhancement were associated with an exaggeration of the estimate of effect (ROR 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.76â1.00). Where allocation concealment for double-blind trials was unclear, the ROR is 0.86 (95\% CI: 0.78â0.96) and if not hidden, the ROR is 0.89 (95\% CI: 0.70â1.15).  Conclusion  Sealed envelopes with some form of enhancement (opaque, sequentially numbered, and so forth) may give adequate concealment. Description of a study as "double blind" does not imply a lack of bias when concealment of allocation is unclear."},

  abstract = {BackgroundWe compared different methods of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and their association with cardiovascular death and major bleeding in 14~980 patients with atrial fibrillation in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial.Methods and ResultseGFR was calculated using equations based on creatinine (CockcroftâGault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKDâEPI]) and/or cystatin C (CKDâEPICysC and CKDâEPICysC+Creatinine). These 5 eGFR equations, as well as the individual variables that are used in these equations, were assessed for correlation and discriminatory ability for cardiovascular death and major bleeding. The median age was 70.0~years, and 35.6\% were women. The median eGFR was highest with CockcroftâGault (74.1 mL/min) and CKDâEPICysC (74.2 mL/min), and lowest with Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (66.5 mL/min). Correlation between methods ranged from 0.49 (CockroftâGault and CKDâEPICysC) to 0.99 (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and CKDâEPI). Among the eGFR equations, those based on cystatin C yielded the highest C indices for cardiovascular death and major bleeding: 0.628 (CKDâEPICysC) and 0.612 (CKDâEPICysC+Creatinine), respectively. A model based on the variables within the different eGFR equations (age, sex, weight, creatinine, and cystatin C) yielded the highest discriminatory value for both outcomes, with a C index of 0.673 and 0.656, respectively.ConclusionsIn patients with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, correlation between eGFR calculated using different methods varied substantially. Cystatin Câbased eGFRs seem to provide the most robust information for predicting death and bleeding. A model based on the individual variables within the eGFR equations, however, provided the highest discriminatory value. Our findings may help refine risk stratification in patients with atrial fibrillation and define how renal function should be determined in future atrial fibrillation studies.RegistrationURL: https://www.clini\hspace{0pt}caltr\hspace{0pt}ials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT00412984.},

By design, both measures were meant to be intuitively appropriate, and the IDI and NRI formulae do look intuitively plausible. Both have become increasingly popular. We shall argue, however, that their use is not always safe. If IDI and NRI are used to measure gain in prediction performance, then poorly calibrated models may appear advantageous, and in a simulation study, even the model that actually generates the data (and hence is the best possible model) can be improved on without adding measured information. We illustrate these shortcomings in actual cancer data as well as by Monte Carlo simulations. In these examples, we contrast IDI and NRI with the area under ROC and the Brier score. Unlike IDI and NRI, these traditional measures have the characteristic that prognostic performance cannot be accidentally or deliberately inflated. Copyright  2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {When fitting a generalized linear model--such as linear regression, logistic regression, or hierarchical linear modeling--analysts often wonder how to handle missing values of the dependent variable Y. If missing values have been filled in using multiple imputation, the usual advice is to use the imputed Y values in analysis. We show, however, that using imputed Ys can add needless noise to the estimates. Better estimates can usually be obtained using a modified strategy that we call multiple imputation, then deletion (MID). Under MID, all cases are used for imputation, but following imputation cases with imputed Y values are excluded from the analysis. When there is something wrong with the imputed Y values, MID protects the estimates from the problematic imputations. And when the imputed Y values are acceptable, MID usually offers somewhat more efficient estimates than an ordinary MI strategy. From Peter Lachenbruch: Going back to Bruce Weaver's comment, I've finished reading van Hippel's paper and the argument is 1. Use all variables to impute all others - this will include the y variable - i.e. a y that is present carries information on the missing x values. 2. After the imputation step, remove all cases in which the y value is missing. The reason for this is that these cases carry no information about the regression of y on the x values. The math for this is outlined in van Hippel's paper. The y values do carry information about the x values (whether missing or not) and so can be used for the imputation. Once imputation is complete, the imputed y values carry no information for the regression - and add nothing further. Thus, by deleting these observations, we obtain a slightly better prediction. In his paper, the simulations are based on normal distributions, and the improvement is small. Nothing was said about imputation and prediction for non-normal (e.g., binary or poisson) cases. Still an open question. 3. For the query posted by Irene Zeng: Missing at baseline is always a pain in the neck, but if you have plenty of other times, you can impute the baseline and then use your Kaplan-Meier estimate (or a proportional hazards model). Using means is almost always a bad idea, and even worse is last observation carried forward (or first observation carried backward).},

  abstract = {Users of multiple imputation often want to know how many imputations they need. An old answer is that 3 to 10 imputations usually suffice, but this recommendation only addresses the efficiency of point estimates. If users also want replicable standard errors, users often need more imputations. A popular rule is that the required number of imputations increases linearly with the fraction of missing information, but we show that, in fact, the number of imputations increases quadratically with the fraction of missing information. This quadratic relationship implies that users should add imputations until the degrees of freedom in the standard errors exceeds some threshold (e.g., 200). We suggest a two-step procedure in which the user conducts a pilot analysis using a small number of imputations and then uses the results to calculate the number of imputations that are needed for a final analysis to have the desired degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {Calibration, that is, whether observed outcomes agree with predicted risks, is important when evaluating risk prediction models. For dichotomous outcomes, several tools exist to assess different aspects of model calibration, such as calibration-in-the-large, logistic recalibration, and (non-)parametric calibration plots. We aim to extend these tools to prediction models for polytomous outcomes. We focus on models developed using multinomial logistic regression (MLR): outcome Y with k categories is predicted using k\,â\,1 equations comparing each category i (i\,=\,2,\,...\,,k) with reference category 1 using a set of predictors, resulting in k\,â\,1 linear predictors. We propose a multinomial logistic recalibration framework that involves an MLR fit where Y is predicted using the k\,â\,1 linear predictors from the prediction model. A non-parametric alternative may use vector splines for the effects of the linear predictors. The parametric and non-parametric frameworks can be used to generate multinomial calibration plots. Further, the parametric framework can be used for the estimation and statistical testing of calibration intercepts and slopes. Two illustrative case studies are presented, one on the diagnosis of malignancy of ovarian tumors and one on residual mass diagnosis in testicular cancer patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The risk prediction models were developed on data from 2037 and 544 patients and externally validated on 1107 and 550 patients, respectively. We conclude that calibration tools can be extended to polytomous outcomes. The polytomous calibration plots are particularly informative through the visual summary of the calibration performance.},

  abstract = {Missing data present challenges for development and real-world application of clinical prediction models. While these challenges have received considerable attention in the development setting, there is only sparse research on the handling of missing data in applied settings. The main unique feature of handling missing data in these settings is that missing data methods have to be performed for a single new individual, precluding direct application of mainstay methods used during model development. Correspondingly, we propose that it is desirable to perform model validation using missing data methods that transfer to practice in single new patients. This article compares existing and new methods to account for missing data for a new individual in the context of prediction. These methods are based on (i) submodels based on observed data only, (ii) marginalization over the missing variables, or (iii) imputation based on fully conditional specification (also known as chained equations). They were compared in an internal validation setting to highlight the use of missing data methods that transfer to practice while validating a model. As a reference, they were compared to the use of multiple imputation by chained equations in a set of test patients, because this has been used in validation studies in the past. The methods were evaluated in a simulation study where performance was measured by means of optimism corrected C-statistic and mean squared prediction error. Furthermore, they were applied in data from a large Dutch cohort of prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients.},

Stepped wedge trials are usually cluster randomised, the intervention being delivered at some geographical, service or other cluster level. There is considerable variety in the design and conduct of stepped wedge trials in practice. The analysis of a stepped wedge trial often assumes that the effect of the intervention is maintained at a constant level once it has been implemented. It is important when estimating this effect to adjust for a period effect or underlying secular trend, since time is confounded with intervention, and to account for the clustering of outcomes. The advantage often cited for a stepped wedge design is that every cluster ends up getting the intervention, though in any trial design we can offer the intervention preferentially to control clusters after the trial has finished. The real advantage of a stepped wedge design is likely to be practicality or statistical efficiency.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Randomized trials typically estimate average relative treatment effects, but decisions on the benefit of a treatment are possibly better informed by more individualized predictions of the absolute treatment effect. In case of a binary outcome, these predictions of absolute individualized treatment effect require knowledge of the individual's risk without treatment and incorporation of a possibly differential treatment effect (ie, varying with patient characteristics). In this article, we lay out the causal structure of individualized treatment effect in terms of potential outcomes and describe the required assumptions that underlie a causal interpretation of its prediction. Subsequently, we describe regression models and model estimation techniques that can be used to move from average to more individualized treatment effect predictions. We focus mainly on logistic regression-based methods that are both well-known and naturally provide the required probabilistic estimates. We incorporate key components from both causal inference and prediction research to arrive at individualized treatment effect predictions. While the separate components are well known, their successful amalgamation is very much an ongoing field of research. We cut the problem down to its essentials in the setting of a randomized trial, discuss the importance of a clear definition of the estimand of interest, provide insight into the required assumptions, and give guidance with respect to modeling and estimation options. Simulated data illustrate the potential of different modeling options across scenarios that vary both average treatment effect and treatment effect heterogeneity. Two applied examples illustrate individualized treatment effect prediction in randomized trial data.},

If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of rejecting erroneously at least one of them increases beyond the pre-specified significance level. Simultaneous inference procedures have to be used which adjust for multiplicity and thus control the overall type I error rate. In this paper we describe simultaneous inference procedures in general parametric models, where the experimental questions are specified through a linear combination of elemental model parameters. The framework described here is quite general and extends the canonical theory of multiple comparison procedures in ANOVA models to linear regression problems, generalized linear models, linear mixed effects models, the Cox model, robust linear models, etc. Several examples using a variety of different statistical models illustrate the breadth of the results. For the analyses we use the R add-on package multcomp, which provides a convenient interface to the general approach adopted here.},

  abstract = {Models for the ordered multiple categorical (OMC) response variable have already been extensively established and widely applied, but few studies have investigated linear regression problems with OMC predictors, especially in high-dimensional situations. In such settings, the pseudocategories of the discrete variable and other irrelevant explanatory variables need to be automatically selected. This paper introduces a transformation method of dummy variables for such OMC predictors, an L1 penalty regression method is proposed based on the transformation. Model selection consistency of the proposed method is derived under some common assumptions for high-dimensional situation. Both simulation studies and real data analysis present good performance of this method, showing its wide applicability in relevant regression analysis.},

We explore the application of Bayesian decision analysis (BDA) to minimize the expected cost of drug approval, where the relative costs of the two types of errors are calibrated using U.S.~Burden of Disease Study 2010 data. The results for conventional fixed-sample randomized clinical-trial designs suggest that for terminal illnesses with no existing therapies such as pancreatic cancer, the standard threshold of 2.5\% is substantially more conservative than the BDA-optimal threshold of 23.9\% to 27.8\%. For relatively less deadly conditions such as prostate cancer, 2.5\% is more risk-tolerant or aggressive than the BDA-optimal threshold of 1.2\% to 1.5\%. We compute BDA-optimal sizes for 25 of the most lethal diseases and show how a BDA-informed approval process can incorporate all stakeholdersâ views in a systematic, transparent, internally consistent, and repeatable manner.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a popular nonparametric tree ensemble procedure with broad applications to data analysis. While its widespread popularity stems from its prediction performance, an equally important feature is that it provides a fully nonparametric measure of variable importance (VIMP). A current limitation of VIMP, however, is that no systematic method exists for estimating its variance. As a solution, we propose a subsampling approach that can be used to estimate the variance of VIMP and for constructing confidence intervals. The method is general enough that it can be applied to many useful settings, including regression, classification, and survival problems. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the subsampling estimator and in particular find that the delete-d jackknife variance estimator, a close cousin, is especially effective under low subsampling rates due to its bias correction properties. These 2 estimators are highly competitive when compared with the .164 bootstrap estimator, a modified bootstrap procedure designed to deal with ties in out-of-sample data. Most importantly, subsampling is computationally fast, thus making it especially attractive for big data settings.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Noninferiority trials in oncology assess novel therapies with the potential for slightly worse recurrence or death outcomes (ie, the margin of noninferiority) than standard therapies. This poses a dilemma because, in the absence of potential health outcome advantages, these trials may not provide the treatment equipoise required for an ethical study. Any new treatment with the potential for slightly worse recurrence or death outcomes should have countervailing health outcome advantages, but these are rarely taken into account in the design of noninferiority trials. This article presents the argument that not only the potentially worse health outcomes but also the potential benefits of the novel therapy should be considered when designing, analyzing, and reporting noninferiority trials. Some approaches to study design and analysis that consider both primary and secondary end points are discussed, and reporting the joint distributions of end points for the novel and standard treatments is recommended.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Conventional analysis using quantile regression typically focuses on fitting the regression model at different quantiles separately. However, in situations where the quantile coefficients share some common feature, joint modeling of multiple quantiles to accommodate the commonality often leads to more efficient estimation. One example of common features is that a predictor may have a constant effect over one region of quantile levels but varying effects in other regions. To automatically perform estimation and detection of the interquantile commonality, we develop two penalization methods. When the quantile slope coefficients indeed do not change across quantile levels, the proposed methods will shrink the slopes toward constant and thus improve the estimation efficiency. We establish the oracle properties of the two proposed penalization methods. Through numerical investigations, we demonstrate that the proposed methods lead to estimations with competitive or higher efficiency than the standard quantile regression estimation in finite samples.

  abstract = {Adherence to medication is critical in achieving effectiveness of many treatments. Factors that influence adherence behavior have been the subject of many clinical studies. Analyzing adherence is complicated because it is often measured on multiple drugs over a period, resulting in a multivariate longitudinal outcome. This paper is motivated by the Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy of Chronic Hepatitis C study, where adherence is measured on two drugs as a bivariate ordinal longitudinal outcome. To analyze such outcome, we propose a joint model assuming the multivariate ordinal outcome arose from a partitioned latent multivariate normal process. We also provide a flexible multilevel association structure covering both between and within outcome correlation. In simulation studies, we show that the joint model provides unbiased estimators for regression parameters, which are more efficient than those obtained through fitting separate model for each outcome. The joint method also yields unbiased estimators for the correlation parameters when the correlation structure is correctly specified. Finally, we analyze the Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy of Chronic Hepatitis C adherence data and discuss the findings.},

We define and compare several methods for specifying early stopping boundaries as functions of interim sample size, rather than as fixed cut-offs, using Bayesian posterior probabilities as decision criteria. We consider boundaries with constant, linear, or exponential shapes. For design optimization criteria, we use the TPP and mean number of patients enrolled in the trial. Simulations to evaluate and compare the designs' operating characteristics under a range of scenarios show that, while there is no uniformly optimal boundary, an appropriately calibrated exponential shape maintains high TPP while limiting the number of patients assigned to a treatment with an inferior response rate or an excessive toxicity rate.},

A group of subjects or groups of subjects are followed over time and observations are often taken at unequally spaced time points, and may be at different times for different subjects. When the errors and random effects are Gaussian, the likelihood of these unbalanced linear mixed models can be directly calculated, and nonlinear optimization used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the fixed regression coefficients and parameters in the variance components. For binary longitudinal data, a two state, non-homogeneous continuous time Markov process approach is used to model serial correlation within subjects. Formulating the model as a continuous time Markov process allows the observations to be equally or unequally spaced. Fixed and time varying covariates can be included in the model, and the continuous time model allows the estimation of the odds ratio for an exposure variable based on the steady state distribution. Exact likelihoods can be calculated. The initial probability distribution on the first observation on each subject is estimated using logistic regression that can involve covariates, and this estimation is embedded in the overall estimation. These models are applied to an intervention study designed to reduce children's sun exposure.},

AIC applies when maximum likelihood is used to estimate the unknown parameters in the model. The value of â2 log likelihood for each model fit is penalized by adding twice the number of estimated parameters. The number of estimated parameters includes both the linear parameters and parameters in the covariance structure. Another criterion for model selection is the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). BIC penalizes â2 log likelihood by adding the number of estimated parameters multiplied by the log of the sample size. For large sample sizes, BIC penalizes â2 log likelihood much more than AIC making it harder to enter new parameters into the model. An assumption in BIC is that the observations are independent. In mixed models, the observations are not independent. This paper develops a method for calculating the `effective sample size' for mixed models based on Fisher's information. The effective sample size replaces the sample size in BIC and can vary from the number of subjects to the number of observations. A number of error models are considered based on a general mixed model including unstructured, compound symmetry (random intercept), first-order autoregression with observational error and random intercept and slope.},

This structure allows some variation in such measures, beyond that explained by sampling variation, to be â normal,â in recognition of the fact that risk-adjustment is never perfect. The shrinkage estimates arising from such a model structure also have appealing properties. It is not immediately clear, however, how â unusualâ providers, that is, any with particularly high or low rates, can be identified based on such a model. Given that some variation in underlying rates is assumed to be the norm, we argue that it is not generally appropriate to identify a provider as interesting based only on evidence of it lying above or below the population mean. We note with concern, however, that this practice is not uncommon. We examine in detail three possible strategies for identifying unusual providers, carefully distinguishing between statistical â outliersâ and â extremes.â A two-level normal model is used for mathematical simplicity, but we note that much of the discussion also applies to alternative data structures. Further, we emphasize throughout that each approach can be viewed as resulting from a Bayesian or a classical perspective. Three worked examples provide additional insight.},

  abstract = {Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) has been advocated for developing clinical prediction models that distinguish between three or more unordered outcomes. We present a full-factorial simulation study to examine the predictive performance of MLR models in relation to the relative size of outcome categories, number of predictors and the number of events per variable. It is shown that MLR estimated by Maximum Likelihood yields overfitted prediction models in small to medium sized data. In most cases, the calibration and overall predictive performance of the multinomial prediction model is improved by using penalized MLR. Our simulation study also highlights the importance of events per variable in the multinomial context as well as the total sample size. As expected, our study demonstrates the need for optimism correction of the predictive performance measures when developing the multinomial logistic prediction model. We recommend the use of penalized MLR when prediction models are developed in small data sets or in medium sized data sets with a small total sample size (ie, when the sizes of the outcome categories are balanced). Finally, we present a case study in which we illustrate the development and validation of penalized and unpenalized multinomial prediction models for predicting malignancy of ovarian cancer.},

  abstract = {Randomized clinical trials with outcome measured longitudinally are frequently analyzed using either random effect models or generalized estimating equations. Both approaches assume that the dropout mechanism is missing at random (MAR) or missing completely at random (MCAR). We propose a Bayesian pattern-mixture model to incorporate missingness mechanisms that might be missing not at random (MNAR), where the distribution of the outcome measure at the follow-up time tk, conditional on the prior history, differs across the patterns of missing data. We then perform sensitivity analysis on estimates of the parameters of interest. The sensitivity parameters relate the distribution of the outcome of interest between subjects from a missing-data pattern at time tk with that of the observed subjects at time tk. The large number of the sensitivity parameters is reduced by treating them as random with a prior distribution having some pre-specified mean and variance, which are varied to explore the sensitivity of inferences. The missing at random (MAR) mechanism is a special case of the proposed model, allowing a sensitivity analysis of deviations from MAR. The proposed approach is applied to data from the Trial of Preventing Hypertension.},

When it is truly necessary to balance the randomization on many stratification variables, it is shown how this inefficiency can be improved by using a sequential randomization method where the first level balances on the crossing of the strata used in the analysis and further stratification variables fall lower in the sequential hierarchy.},

In this paper, we propose three new sample-size determination methods for an exploratory trial, which utilize the posterior probabilities calculated from predefined efficacy and inefficacy criteria leading to a declaration of the worthwhileness or unpromisingness of the experimental treatment. Simulation studies, including numerical investigation, showed that all three methods could declare the experimental treatment as worthwhile or unpromising with a high probability when the true response probability of the experimental treatment group is higher or lower, respectively, than that of the control treatment group.},

  abstract = {The key idea of statistical hypothesis testing is to fix, and thereby control, the Type I error (false positive) rate across samples of any size. Multiple comparisons inflate the global (family-wise) Type I error rate and the traditional solution to maintaining control of the error rate is to increase the local (comparison-wise) Type II error (false negative) rates. However, in the analysis of human brain imaging data, the number of comparisons is so large that this solution breaks down: the local Type II error rate ends up being so large that scientifically meaningful analysis is precluded. Here we propose a novel solution to this problem: allow the Type I error rate to converge to zero along with the Type II error rate. It works because when the Type I error rate per comparison is very small, the accumulation (or global) Type I error rate is also small. This solution is achieved by employing the likelihood paradigm, which uses likelihood ratios to measure the strength of evidence on a voxel-by-voxel basis. In this paper, we provide theoretical and empirical justification for a likelihood approach to the analysis of human brain imaging data. In addition, we present extensive simulations that show the likelihood approach is viable, leading to "cleaner"-looking brain maps and operational superiority (lower average error rate). Finally, we include a case study on cognitive control related activation in the prefrontal cortex of the human brain. Copyright  2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We see this type of approach in clinical trials as a seamless Phase IIâPhase III design. These designs require more statistical support and are less straightforward to plan and analyze than a standard single-stage design. To diminish the barriers associated with a Bayesian two-stage drop-the-losers design, we built a user-friendly point-and-click graphical user interface with R Shiny to aid researchers in planning such designs by allowing them to easily obtain trial operating characteristics, estimate statistical power and sample size, and optimize patient allocation in each stage to maximize power. We assume that endpoints are distributed normally with unknown but common variance between treatments. We recommend this software as an easy way to engage statisticians and researchers in two-stage designs as well as to actively investigate the power of two-stage designs relative to more traditional approaches.

In particular, some stepped wedge designs with missing clusterâperiod âcellsâ have been proposed without any formal justification. Indeed there are no general guidelines regarding which cells of a stepped wedge design contribute the least information toward estimation of the treatment effect, and correspondingly which may be preferentially omitted. In this article, we define a metric of the information content of clusterâperiod cells, entire treatment sequences, and entire periods of the standard stepped wedge design as the increase in variance of the estimator of the treatment effect when that cell, sequence, or period is omitted. We show that the most information-rich cells are those that occur immediately before or after treatment switches, but also that there are additional cells that contribute almost as much to the estimation of the treatment effect. However, the information content patterns depend on the assumed correlation structure for the repeated measurements within a cluster.},

  abstract = {Background:Researchers often wish to test a large set of related interventions or approaches to implementation. A factorial experiment accomplishes this by examining not only basic treatment?control comparisons but also the effects of multiple implementation ?factors? such as different dosages or implementation strategies and the interactions between these factor levels. However, traditional methods of statistical inference may require prohibitively large sample sizes to perform complex factorial experiments.Objectives:We present a Bayesian approach to factorial design. Through the use of hierarchical priors and partial pooling, we show how Bayesian analysis substantially increases the precision of estimates in complex experiments with many factors and factor levels, while controlling the risk of false positives from multiple comparisons.Research design:Using an experiment we performed for the U.S. Department of Education as a motivating example, we perform power calculations for both classical and Bayesian methods. We repeatedly simulate factorial experiments with a variety of sample sizes and numbers of treatment arms to estimate the minimum detectable effect (MDE) for each combination.Results:The Bayesian approach yields substantially lower MDEs when compared with classical methods for complex factorial experiments. For example, to test 72 treatment arms (five factors with two or three levels each), a classical experiment requires nearly twice the sample size as a Bayesian experiment to obtain a given MDE.Conclusions:Bayesian methods are a valuable tool for researchers interested in studying complex interventions. They make factorial experiments with many treatment arms vastly more feasible.},

  abstract = {When calculating sample size or power for stepped wedge or other types of longitudinal cluster randomized trials, it is critical that the planned sampling structure be accurately specified. One common assumption is that participants will provide measurements in each trial period, that is, a closed cohort, and another is that each participant provides only one measurement during the course of the trial. However some studies have an âopen cohortâ sampling structure, where participants may provide measurements in variable numbers of periods. To date, sample size calculations for longitudinal cluster randomized trials have not accommodated open cohorts. Feldman and McKinlay (1994) provided some guidance, stating that the participant-level autocorrelation could be varied to account for the degree of overlap in different periods of the study, but did not indicate precisely how to do so. We present sample size and power formulas that allow for open cohorts and discuss the impact of the degree of âopennessâ on sample size and power. We consider designs where the number of participants in each cluster will be maintained throughout the trial, but individual participants may provide differing numbers of measurements. Our results are a unification of closed cohort and repeated cross-sectional sample results of Hooper et al (2016), and indicate precisely how participant autocorrelation of Feldman and McKinlay should be varied to account for an open cohort sampling structure. We discuss different types of open cohort sampling schemes and how open cohort sampling structure impacts on power in the presence of decaying within-cluster correlations and autoregressive participant-level errors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to define the association between a genetic risk score (GRS) that combined the effect of multiple BMI-associated variants and gestational weight trajectory. Because pregnancy is a state of sympathetic activation, the association between gestational weight trajectory and variants in adrenergic pathways previously associated with weight was examined. METHODS: In a previously defined cohort of pregnant women with (n\,=\,1,504) and without gestational diabetes (GDM) (n\,=\,435), weight trajectory was calculated using all weights during pregnancy. A GRS for BMI (GRSBMI ) was calculated using 31 common variants associated with BMI, and 10 variants in the adrenergic pathways were genotyped. Clinical and genetic factors were studied using generalized linear models. RESULTS: Prepregnancy BMI was associated with the GRSBMI (P\,=\,9.3\,Ã\,10-11 ) and parity (P\,=\,4.54\,Ã\,10-17 ). The GRSBMI was associated with gestational weight trajectory in women with and without GDM (P\,=\,0.041 and P\,{$<$}\,0.0001, respectively); however, when prepregnancy BMI was included in the models, the associations disappeared (P\,{$>$}\,0.05). Variants in adrenergic genes were not associated with gestational weight trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: A GRS for BMI was associated with prepregnancy BMI but was not independently associated with gestational weight trajectory in women with and without GDM. Selected variants in adrenergic genes were not associated with gestational weight trajectory.},

  abstract = {In this article, we first review the literature on dealing with missing values on a covariate in randomized studies and summarize what has been done and what is lacking to date. We then investigate the situation with a continuous outcome and a missing binary covariate in more details through simulations, comparing the performance of multiple imputation (MI) with various simple alternative methods. This is finally extended to the case of time-to-event outcome. The simulations consider five different missingness scenarios: missing completely at random (MCAR), at random (MAR) with missingness depending only on the treatment, and missing not at random (MNAR) with missingness depending on the covariate itself (MNAR1), missingness depending on both the treatment and covariate (MNAR2), and missingness depending on the treatment, covariate and their interaction (MNAR3). Here, we distinguish two different cases: (1) when the covariate is measured before randomization (best practice), where only MCAR and MNAR1 are plausible, and (2) when it is measured after randomization but before treatment (which sometimes occurs in nonpharmaceutical research), where the other three missingness mechanisms can also occur. The proposed methods are compared based on the treatment effect estimate and its standard error. The simulation results suggest that the patterns of results are very similar for all missingness scenarios in case (1) and also in case (2) except for MNAR3. Furthermore, in each scenario for continuous outcome, there is at least one simple method that performs at least as well as MI, while for time-to-event outcome MI is best.},

  abstract = {Stepped wedge cluster randomized trials (SW-CRTs) have become increasingly popular and are used for a variety of interventions and outcomes, often chosen for their feasibility advantages. SW-CRTs must account for time trends in the outcome because of the staggered rollout of the intervention. Robust inference procedures and nonparametric analysis methods have recently been proposed to handle such trends without requiring strong parametric modeling assumptions, but these are less powerful than model-based approaches. We propose several novel analysis methods that reduce reliance on modeling assumptions while preserving some of the increased power provided by the use of mixed effects models. In one method, we use the synthetic control approach to find the best matching clusters for a given intervention cluster. Another method makes use of within-cluster crossover information to construct an overall estimator. We also consider methods that combine these approaches to further improve power. We test these methods on simulated SW-CRTs, describing scenarios in which these methods have increased power compared with existing nonparametric methods while preserving nominal validity when mixed effects models are misspecified. We also demonstrate theoretical properties of these estimators with less restrictive assumptions than mixed effects models. Finally, we propose avenues for future research on the use of these methods; motivation for such research arises from their flexibility, which allows the identification of specific causal contrasts of interest, their robustness, and the potential for incorporating covariates to further increase power. Investigators conducting SW-CRTs might well consider such methods when common modeling assumptions may not hold.},

  abstract = {Importance: Interpreting randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and their clinical relevance is challenging when P values are either marginally above or below the P\,=\,.05 threshold. Objective: To use the concept of reverse fragility index (RFI) to provide a measure of confidence in the neutrality of RCT results when assessed from the clinical perspective. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, a MEDLINE search was conducted for RCTs published from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018, in JAMA, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), and The Lancet. Eligible studies were phase 3 and 4 trials with 1:1 randomization and statistically nonsignificant binary primary end points. Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2019, to August 31, 2019. Exposures: Single vs multicenter enrollment, total number of events, private vs government funding, placebo vs active control, and time to event vs frequency data. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the median RFI with interquartile range (IQR) at the P\,=\,.05 threshold. Secondary outcomes were the number of RCTs in which the number of participants lost to follow-up was greater than the RFI; the median RFI with IQR at different P value thresholds; the median reverse fragility quotient with IQR; and the correlation between sample sizes, number of events, and P values of the RCT and RFI. Results: Of the 167 RCTs included, 76 (46\%) were published in the NEJM, 50 (30\%) in JAMA, and 41 (24\%) in The Lancet. The median (IQR) sample size was 970 (470-3427) participants, and the median (IQR) number of events was 251 (105-570). The median (IQR) RFI at the P\,=\,.05 threshold was 8 (5-13).

The median (IQR) RFI at the P\,=\,.01 threshold was 12 (7-19) and at the P\,=\,.005 threshold was 14 (9-21). Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found that a relatively small number of events (median of 8) had to change to move the primary end point of an RCT from nonsignificant to statistically significant.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modern healthcare reforms focus on identifying and measuring the quality and value of care. Patient satisfaction is particularly important in the management of degenerative cervical radiculopathy (DCR) since it leads to significant neck pain and disability primarily affecting the patients' quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of baseline and 12-mo Neck Disability Index (NDI) with patient satisfaction after elective surgery for DCR. METHODS: The Quality Outcomes Database cervical module was queried for patients who underwent elective surgery for DCR. A multivariable proportional odds regression model was fitted with 12-mo satisfaction as the outcome. The covariates for this model included patients' demographics, surgical characteristics, and baseline and 12-mo patient reported outcomes (PROs). Wald-statistics were calculated to determine the relative importance of each independent variable for 12-mo patient satisfaction. RESULTS: The analysis included 2206 patients who underwent elective surgery for DCR. In multivariable analysis, after adjusting for baseline and surgery specific variables, the 12-mo NDI score showed the highest association with 12-mo satisfaction (WaldÏ2-df~=~99.17, 58.1\% of total Ï2). The level of satisfaction increases with decrease in 12-mo NDI score regardless of the baseline NDI score. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies 12-mo NDI score as a very influential driver of 12-mo patient satisfaction after surgery for DCR. In addition, there are lesser contributions from other 12-mo PROs, baseline Numeric Rating Scale for arm pain and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade. The baseline level of disability was found to be irrelevant to patients. They seemed to only value their current level of disability, compared to baseline, in rating satisfaction with surgical outcome.},

  abstract = {In recent studies of humans estimating non-stationary probabilities, estimates appear to be unbiased on average, across the full range of probability values to be estimated. This finding is surprising given that experiments measuring probability estimation in other contexts have often identified conservatism: individuals tend to overestimate low probability events and underestimate high probability events. In other contexts, repulsive biases have also been documented, with individuals producing judgments that tend toward extreme values instead. Using extensive data from a probability estimation task that produces unbiased performance on average, we find substantial biases at the individual level; we document the coexistence of both conservative and repulsive biases in the same experimental context. Individual biases persist despite extensive experience with the task, and are also correlated with other behavioral differences, such as individual variation in response speed and adjustment rates. We conclude that the rich computational demands of our task give rise to a variety of behavioral patterns, and that the apparent unbiasedness of the pooled data is an artifact of the aggregation of heterogeneous biases.},

  abstract = {Recurrent event data frequently occur in longitudinal studies when subjects experience more than one event during the observation period. Often, the occurrence of subsequent events is associated with the experience of previous events. Such dependence is commonly ignored in the application of standard recurrent event methodology. In this paper, we utilize a Cox-type regression model with time-varying triggering effect depending on the number and timing of previous events to enhance both model fit and prediction. Parameter estimation and statistical inference is achieved via the partial likelihood. A statistical test procedure is provided to assess the existence of the triggering effects. We demonstrate our approach via comprehensive simulation studies and a real data analysis on chronic pseudomonas infections in young cystic fibrosis patients. Our model provides significantly better predictions than standard recurrent event models.},

  abstract = {Objectives We aimed to compare modeling approaches to estimate the individual survival benefit of treatment with either coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with complex coronary artery disease. Study Design and Setting We estimated survival with Cox regression models that included the treatment variable (CABG/PCI) interacting with either an internally developed overall prognostic index (PI) or with individual prognostic factors. We analyzed data of patients who were randomized in the Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery trial (1,800 patients, 178 deaths). Results A negligible interaction with the PI (P = 0.51) led to 4-year survival estimates in favor of CABG for all patients. In contrast, individual interactions indicated substantial relative treatment effect heterogeneity (overall interaction P = 0.004), and estimates of 4-year survival were numerically in favor of CABG for 1,275 of 1,800 patients (71\%; 519 with 95\% confidence). To test the more complex model with individual interactions, we first used penalized regression, resulting in smaller but largely consistent individual estimates of the survival difference between CABG and PCI. Second, strong treatment interactions were confirmed at external validation in 2,891 patients from a multinational registry. Conclusion Modeling strategies that omit interactions may result in misleading estimates of absolute treatment benefit for individual patients with the potential hazard of suboptimal decision making.},

We assessed predictions of treatment benefit for four regression models: a "risk model" (with a constant effect of treatment assignment) and three "effect models" (including interactions of risk predictors with treatment assignment). Three novel performance measures were evaluated: calibration-for-benefit (i.e. observed versus predicted risk difference in treated versus untreated), discrimination-for-benefit, and prediction error-for-benefit.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The risk-modeling approach was well-calibrated for benefit while effect models were consistently overfit, even with doubled sample sizes. Penalized regression reduced miscalibration of the effect models considerably. In terms of discrimination and prediction error, the risk-modeling approach was superior in the absence of true treatment effect interactions, while penalized regression was optimal in the presence of true treatment interactions.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusion{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}A risk-modeling approach yields models consistently well-calibrated for benefit. Effect-modeling may improve discrimination-for-benefit in the presence of true interactions, but is prone to overfitting.

  abstract = {Life expectancy has dramatically increased in industrialized nations over the last 200 hundred years. The aging of populations carries over to clinical research and leads to an increasing representation of elderly and multimorbid individuals in study populations. Clinical research in these populations is complicated by the fact that individuals are likely to experience several potential disease endpoints that prevent some disease-specific endpoint of interest from occurrence. Large developments in competing risks methodology have been achieved over the last decades, but we assume that recognition of competing risks in the clinical community is still marginal. It is the aim of this article to address translational aspects of competing risks to the clinical community. We describe clinical populations where competing risks issues may arise. We then discuss the importance of agreement between the competing risks methodology and the study aim, in particular the distinction between etiologic and prognostic research questions. In a review of 50 clinical studies performed in individuals susceptible to competing risks published in high-impact clinical journals, we found competing risks issues in 70\% of all articles. Better recognition of issues related to competing risks and of statistical methods that deal with competing risks in accordance with the aim of the study is needed.},

  abstract = {Although studies have linked vitamin D deficiency with immune-mediated diseases, data demonstrating a direct effect on T-cell function are sparse. Our objective was to determine whether oral vitamin D3 influences T-cell activation in humans with vitamin D deficiency. This was a single-center ancillary study within Vitamin D Therapy in Individuals at High Risk of Hypertension, a double-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. This study was undertaken in a single academic medical center. Adults with vitamin D deficiency and untreated pre- or early stage I hypertension were included. In Vitamin D Therapy in Individuals at High Risk of Hypertension, participants were randomized to either low- (400 IU daily) or high- (4000 IU daily) dose oral vitamin D3 for 6 months. In this ancillary study of 38 patients, we measured CD4+ T-cell activation estimated by intracellular ATP release after stimulation of whole blood with plant lectin phytohemagglutinin collected at baseline (pretreatment) and 2-month follow-up. Determining whether ATP level changes were significantly different between treatment groups was the main outcome measure. Treatment with 4000 IU of vitamin D3 decreased intracellular CD4+ ATP release by 95.5 ng/ml (interquartile range, -219.5 to 105.8). In contrast, 400 IU of vitamin D3 decreased intracellular CD4+ ATP release by 0.5 ng/ml (interquartile range, -69.2 to 148.5). In a proportional odds model, high-dose vitamin D3 was more likely than low-dose vitamin D3 to decrease CD4+ ATP release (odds ratio, 3.43; 95\% confidence interval, 1.06-1.11). In this ancillary study of a randomized controlled trial, we found that high-dose vitamin D3 significantly reduced CD4+ T-cell activation compared to low-dose vitamin D3, providing human evidence that vitamin D can influence cell-mediated immunity.},

  abstract = {In the era of precision medicine, novel designs are developed to deal with flexible clinical trials that incorporate many treatment strategies for multiple diseases in one trial setting. This situation often leads to small sample sizes in disease-treatment combinations and has fostered the discussion about the benefits of borrowing of external or historical information for decision-making in these trials. Several methods have been proposed that dynamically discount the amount of information borrowed from historical data based on the conformity between historical and current data. Specifically, Bayesian methods have been recommended and numerous investigations have been performed to characterize the properties of the various borrowing mechanisms with respect to the gain to be expected in the trials. However, there is common understanding that the risk of type I error inflation exists when information is borrowed and many simulation studies are carried out to quantify this effect. To add transparency to the debate, we show that if prior information is conditioned upon and a uniformly most powerful test exists, strict control of type I error implies that no power gain is possible under any mechanism of incorporation of prior information, including dynamic borrowing. The basis of the argument is to consider the test decision function as a function of the current data even when external information is included. We exemplify this finding in the case of a pediatric arm appended to an adult trial and dichotomous outcome for various methods of dynamic borrowing from adult information to the pediatric arm. In conclusion, if use of relevant external data is desired, the requirement of strict type I error control has to be replaced by more appropriate metrics.},

  abstract = {A new distribution free inferential procedure for comparing paired observations, called the ârank difference testâ, is presented. The new procedure is based on ranks, and is applicable as a robust alternative to the related f test in all situations where the Wilcoxon signed ranks test is applicable. In additions it may be applied to ordinal data or operational measures which do not meet the assumptions underlying the Wilcoxon. Since the rank difference statistic, D, can take on half-integer, as well as integer, values, it has continuity advantages over the Wilcoxon for small samples. The exact null distribution of the rank difference test statistic, D, is derived and tabulated for samples sizes from 2 to 7 pairs. The null distribution of the rank difference test statistic is shown to be asymptotically the same as that of the Wilcoxon test statistic for large sample sizes. Permutation methods are used to derive the null distribution for sample sizes from 8 to 20 based on 400000 simulations for each sample size. The practical application of the rank difference test is evaluated by comparing its power and performance with that of the Wilcoxon, the sign test and the related t test, for several classic sets of data in the literature, and for several sets of simulated data.},

The shortcomings and misunderstandings are not unique to NNT, but may be present for other measures such as RRR, ARR, and gain in life expectancy. Doctors may do well to accept that decision making under uncertainty is difficult. The decision maker ought to know baseline risk, ARR/NNT, as well as preferences for future health gains. Can one single measure of benefit - 'a simple yardstick' - convey all the necessary information? The answer is probably negative. If one measure could perform this role, it is unlikely to be NNT."

  abstract = {Sample size derivation is a crucial element of planning any confirmatory trial. The required sample size is typically derived based on constraints on the maximal acceptable Type I error rate and minimal desired power. Power depends on the unknown true effect and tends to be calculated either for the smallest relevant effect or a likely point alternative. The former might be problematic if the minimal relevant effect is close to the null, thus requiring an excessively large sample size, while the latter is dubious since it does not account for the a priori uncertainty about the likely alternative effect. A Bayesian perspective on sample size derivation for a frequentist trial can reconcile arguments about the relative a priori plausibility of alternative effects with ideas based on the relevance of effect sizes. Many suggestions as to how such âhybridâ approaches could be implemented in practice have been put forward. However, key quantities are often defined in subtly different ways in the literature. Starting from the traditional entirely frequentist approach to sample size derivation, we derive consistent definitions for the most commonly used hybrid quantities and highlight connections, before discussing and demonstrating their use in sample size derivation for clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Motivated by a preclinical study in a mouse model of breast cancer, we suggest a joint modeling framework for outcomes of mixed type and measurement structures (longitudinal versus single time/time-invariant). We present an approach based on the time-varying copula models, which is used to jointly model longitudinal outcomes of mixed types via a time-varying copula, and extend the scope of these models to handle outcomes with mixed measurement structures. Our framework allows the parameters corresponding to the longitudinal outcome to be time varying and thereby enabling researchers to investigate how the response-predictor relationships change with time. We investigate the finite sample performance of this new approach via a Monte Carlo simulation study and illustrate its usefulness by an empirical analysis of the motivating preclinical study, comparing the effect of various treatments on tumor volume (longitudinal continuous response) and the number of days until tumor volume triples (time-invariant count response). Through the real-life application and the simulation study, we demonstrate that, compared with marginal modeling, the joint modeling framework offers more precision in the estimation of model parameters.},

While, at first sight, a Bayesian PK-PD framework seems to be a natural framework to allow for sequential knowledge integration, the scope of this paper is to highlight some often-overlooked challenges while at the same time providing some guidances in the many and overwhelming choices that need to be made. Challenges as well as opportunities will be discussed that are related to the impact of (1) the prior specification, (2) the choice of random effects, (3) the type of sequential integration method. In addition, it will be shown how the success of a sequential integration strategy is highly dependent on a carefully chosen experimental design when small trials are analyzed.},

  abstract = {The power of a chi-square test, and thus the required sample size, are a function of the noncentrality parameter that can be obtained as the limiting expectation of the test statistic under an alternative hypothesis specification. Herein, we apply this principle to derive simple expressions for two tests that are commonly applied to discrete ordinal data. The Wilcoxon rank sum test for the equality of distributions in two groups is algebraically equivalent to the MannâWhitney test. The KruskalâWallis test applies to multiple groups. These tests are equivalent to a CochranâMantelâHaenszel mean score test using rank scores for a set of C-discrete categories. Although various authors have assessed the power function of the Wilcoxon and MannâWhitney tests, herein it is shown that the power of these tests with discrete observations, that is, with tied ranks, is readily provided by the power function of the corresponding Cochran--Mantel--Haenszel mean scores test for two and R\,{$>$}\,2 groups. These expressions yield results virtually identical to those derived previously for rank scores and also apply to other score functions. The CochranâArmitage test for trend assesses whether there is an monotonically increasing or decreasing trend in the proportions with a positive outcome or response over the C-ordered categories of an ordinal independent variable, for example, dose. Herein, it is shown that the power of the test is a function of the slope of the response probabilities over the ordinal scores assigned to the groups that yields simple expressions for the power of the test.},

  abstract = {Bayesian modelâbased clustering provides a powerful and flexible tool that can be incorporated into regression models to better understand the grouping of observations. Using data from the Seychelles Child Development Study, we explore the effect of prenatal methylmercury exposure on 20 neurodevelopmental outcomes measured in 9-year-old children. Rather than cluster individual subjects, we cluster the outcomes within a multiple outcomes model. By using information in the data to nest the outcomes into groups called domains, the model more accurately reflects the shared characteristics of neurodevelopmental domains and improves estimation of the overall and outcome-specific exposure effects by shrinking effects within and between domains selected by the data. The Bayesian paradigm allows for sampling from the posterior distribution of the grouping parameters; thus, inference can be made about group membership and their defining characteristics. We avoid the often difficult and highly subjective requirement of a priori identification of the total number of groups by incorporating a Dirichlet process prior to form a fully Bayesian multiple outcomes model.},

  abstract = {One can fruitfully approach survival problems without covariates in an actuarial way. In narrow time bins, the number of people at risk is counted together with the number of events. The relationship between time and probability of an event can then be estimated with a parametric or semi-parametric model. The number of events observed in each bin is described using a Poisson distribution with the log mean specified using a flexible penalized B-splines model with a large number of equidistant knots. Regression on pertinent covariates can easily be performed using the same log-linear model, leading to the classical proportional hazard model. We propose to extend that model by allowing the regression coefficients to vary in a smooth way with time. Penalized B-splines models will be proposed for each of these coefficients. We show how the regression parameters and the penalty weights can be estimated efficiently using Bayesian inference tools based on the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm.

  abstract = {The logistic regression model is frequently used in epidemiologic studies, yielding odds ratio or relative risk interpretations. Inspired by the theory of linear normal models, the logistic regression model has been extended to allow for correlated responses by introducing random effects. However, the model does not inherit the interpretational features of the normal model. In this paper, the authors argue that the existing measures are unsatisfactory (and some of them are even improper) when quantifying results from multilevel logistic regression analyses. The authors suggest a measure of heterogeneity, the median odds ratio, that quantifies cluster heterogeneity and facilitates a direct comparison between covariate effects and the magnitude of heterogeneity in terms of well-known odds ratios. Quantifying cluster-level covariates in a meaningful way is a challenge in multilevel logistic regression. For this purpose, the authors propose an odds ratio measure, the interval odds ratio, that takes these difficulties into account. The authors demonstrate the two measures by investigating heterogeneity between neighborhoods and effects of neighborhood-level covariates in two examples--public physician visits and ischemic heart disease hospitalizations--using 1999 data on 11,312 men aged 45-85 years in Malmo, Sweden.},

In this article, the data concern the degree of lesions in pigs, related to the behaviour of these animals. The experimental design corresponded to two levels of environmental enrichment and four levels of genetic lineages in a completely randomized factorial with data collected longitudinally over four time occasions. The transition models used for the data analysis are based on stochastic processes and Generalized Linear Models. In general, these are not used for analysis of longitudinal data but they are useful in many situations as in this study. We present some aspects of this class of models for the stationary case. The proportional odds transition model is used to construct the matrix of transition probabilities and a function was developed in the R system to fit this model. The likelihood ratio test was used to verify the assumption of odds ratio proportionality and to select the structure of the linear predictor. The methodology used allowed for the choice of a model that can be used to explain the relationship between the severity of lesions in pigs and the use of the environmental enrichment.},

  abstract = {Although the frequentist paradigm has been the predominant approach to clinical trial design since the 1940s, it has several notable limitations. Advancements in computational algorithms and computer hardware have greatly enhanced the alternative Bayesian paradigm. Compared with its frequentist counterpart, the Bayesian framework has several unique advantages, and its incorporation into clinical trial design is occurring more frequently. Using an extensive literature review to assess how Bayesian methods are used in clinical trials, we find them most commonly used for dose finding, efficacy monitoring, toxicity monitoring, diagnosis/decision making, and studying pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. The additional infrastructure required for implementing Bayesian methods in clinical trials may include specialized software programs to run the study design, simulation and analysis, and web-based applications, all of which are particularly useful for timely data entry and analysis. Trial success requires not only the development of proper tools but also timely and accurate execution of data entry, quality control, adaptive randomization, and Bayesian computation. The relative merit of the Bayesian and frequentist approaches continues to be the subject of debate in statistics. However, more evidence can be found showing the convergence of the two camps, at least at the practical level. Ultimately, better clinical trial methods lead to more efficient designs, lower sample sizes, more accurate conclusions, and better outcomes for patients enrolled in the trials. Bayesian methods offer attractive alternatives for better trials. More Bayesian trials should be designed and conducted to refine the approach and demonstrate their real benefit in action.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Multiple imputation is becoming increasingly popular for handling missing data. However, it is often implemented without adequate consideration of whether it offers any advantage over complete case analysis for the research question of interest, or whether potential gains may be offset by bias from a poorly fitting imputation model, particularly as the amount of missing data increases.METHODS:Simulated datasets (n=1000) drawn from a synthetic population were used to explore information recovery from multiple imputation in estimating the coefficient of a binary exposure variable when various proportions of data (10-90\%) were set missing at random in a highly-skewed continuous covariate or in the binary exposure. Imputation was performed using multivariate normal imputation (MVNI), with a simple or zero-skewness log transformation to manage non-normality. Bias, precision, mean-squared error and coverage for a set of regression parameter estimates were compared between multiple imputation and complete case analyses.RESULTS:For missingness in the continuous covariate, multiple imputation produced less bias and greater precision for the effect of the binary exposure variable, compared with complete case analysis, with larger gains in precision with more missing data. However, even with only moderate missingness, large bias and substantial under-coverage were apparent in estimating the continuous covariate's effect when skewness was not adequately addressed. For missingness in the binary covariate, all estimates had negligible bias but gains in precision from multiple imputation were minimal, particularly for the coefficient of the binary exposure.CONCLUSIONS:Although multiple imputation can be useful if covariates required for confounding adjustment are missing, benefits are likely to be minimal when data are missing in the exposure variable of interest. Furthermore, when there are large amounts of missingness, multiple imputation can become unreliable and introduce bias not present in a complete case analysis if the imputation model is not appropriate. Epidemiologists dealing with missing data should keep in mind the potential limitations as well as the potential benefits of multiple imputation. Further work is needed to provide clearer guidelines on effective application of this method.},

The 2 alternating states defined by these recurrent events could each carry important and distinct information about a patient's underlying health condition and/or the quality of care. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric method for evaluating covariate effects on the 2 alternating states jointly. The proposed methodology accounts for the dependence among the alternating states as well as the heterogeneity across patients via a frailty with unspecified distribution. Moreover, the estimation procedure, which is based on smooth estimating equations, not only properly addresses challenges such as induced dependent censoring and intercept sampling bias commonly confronted in serial event gap time data but also is more computationally tractable than the existing rank-based methods. The proposed methods are evaluated by simulation studies and illustrated by analyzing psychiatric contacts from the South Verona Psychiatric Case Register.},

Such models retain marginal features with a simple interpretation, reflect the heterogeneity in risk for each type of event, and provide insight into the dependence between the different types of events.

  abstract = {The second stage of labour begins when the cervix is fully dilated and pushing begins until the fetus is delivered. A Caesarean delivery (CD) or operative vaginal delivery (OVD) is typically encouraged after the recommended time set by âexpert consensusâ. This recommended time has been set out of concern for an increased chance of maternal and neonatal morbidities due to a prolonged second stage of labour, but without thorough consideration of heterogeneous risks for spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) and morbidities among women. To provide quantitative evidence for the recommendation, the first step is to compare the risks for SVD, CD or OVD, and the risks of maternal or neonatal morbidities simultaneously across the duration of the second stage of labour. To address such risk comparisons statistically, one needs to study the joint distribution for the time to delivery due to each mode and time to maternal or neonatal morbidity given information provided for each individual. We introduce a joint model which combines the competing risks data for delivery time and current status data for any type of maternal or neonatal morbidity given each woman's baseline characteristics. These two processes are assumed dependent through individual-specific frailty under the joint model. Our numerical studies include a simulation that reflects the structure of observed real data and a detailed real data analysis based on nearly 12000 spontaneous labours. Our finding indicates the necessity to incorporate maternal characteristic such as age or body mass index in assessing the probability for delivery due to SVD, CD or OVD and the onset of morbidities across the second stage of labour.},

  abstract = {For decades, statisticians, philosophers, medical investigators and others interested in data analysis have argued that the Bayesian paradigm is the proper approach for reporting the results of scientific analyses for use by clients and readers. To date, the methods have been too complicated for non-statisticians to use. In this paper we argue that the World-Wide Web provides the perfect environment to put the Bayesian paradigm into practice: the likelihood function of the data is parsimoniously represented on the server side, the reader uses the client to represent her prior belief, and a downloaded program (a Java applet) performs the combination. In our approach, a different applet can be used for each likelihood function, prior belief can be assessed graphically, and calculation results can be reported in a variety of ways. We present a prototype implementation, BayesApplet, for two-arm clinical trials with normally-distributed outcomes, a prominent model for clinical trials. The primary implication of this work is that publishing medical research results on the Web can take a form beyond or different from that currently used on paper, and can have a profound impact on the publication and use of research results.},

  abstract = {This article develops a pair of new prediction summary measures for a nonlinear prediction function with right-censored time-to-event data. The first measure, defined as the proportion of explained variance by a linearly corrected prediction function, quantifies the potential predictive power of the nonlinear prediction function. The second measure, defined as the proportion of explained prediction error by its corrected prediction function, gauges the closeness of the prediction function to its corrected version and serves as a supplementary measure to indicate (by a value less than 1) whether the correction is needed to fulfill its potential predictive power and quantify how much prediction error reduction can be realized with the correction. The two measures together provide a complete summary of the predictive accuracy of the nonlinear prediction function. We motivate these measures by first establishing a variance decomposition and a prediction error decomposition at the population level and then deriving uncensored and censored sample versions of these decompositions. We note that for the least square prediction function under the linear model with no censoring, the first measure reduces to the classical coefficient of determination and the second measure degenerates to 1. We show that the sample measures are consistent estimators of their population counterparts and conduct extensive simulations to investigate their finite sample properties. A real data illustration is provided using the PBC data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online. An R package PAmeasures has been developed and made available via the CRAN R library. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {In stepped wedge cluster randomized trials, intact clusters of individuals switch from control to intervention from a randomly assigned period onwards. Such trials are becoming increasingly popular in health services research. When a closed cohort is recruited from each cluster for longitudinal followâup, proper sample size calculation should account for three distinct types of intraclass correlations: the withinâperiod, the interâperiod, and the withinâindividual correlations. Setting the latter two correlation parameters to be equal accommodates crossâsectional designs. We propose sample size procedures for continuous and binary responses within the framework of generalized estimating equations that employ a block exchangeable withinâcluster correlation structure defined from the distinct correlation types. For continuous responses, we show that the intraclass correlations affect power only through two eigenvalues of the correlation matrix. We demonstrate that analytical power agrees well with simulated power for as few as eight clusters, when data are analyzed using biasâcorrected estimating equations for the correlation parameters concurrently with a biasâcorrected sandwich variance estimator.},

We proposed a Bayesian multicriteria decision-making method for BRA of drugs using individual-level data. We used a multidimensional latent trait model to account for the heterogeneity of treatment effects with latent variables introducing the dependencies among outcomes. We then applied the stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis approach for BRA incorporating imprecise and heterogeneous patient preference information. We adopted an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm when implementing the proposed method.

  abstract = {Recurrent events could be stopped by a terminal event, which commonly occurs in biomedical and clinical studies. Taking the Cardiovascular Health Study as a motivating example, patients can experience recurrent events of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke during follow-up, which, however, can be truncated by death. Since death could be a devastating complication of MI or stroke recurrences, ignoring dependent censoring when analysing recurrent events may lead to invalid inference. The joint shared frailty model is widely used but with several limitations: two event processes are conditionally independent given the subject level frailty, which could be violated because the dependence may rely on unknown covariates varying across recurrences; the correlation between recurrent events and death is constant over time because of the same frailty within subject, but MI or stroke recurrences could have a time-varying influence on death due to higher risk of another event of MI or stroke after the first. We propose a time-varying joint hierarchical copula model under the Bayesian framework to accommodate correlation between recurrent events and dependence between two event processes which may change over time. The performance of our method is extensively evaluated by simulation studies, and lastly by the Cardiovascular Health Study for illustration.},

Recently, with increasing complexity of medical therapies and technological advances in monitoring multiple outcomes, many clinical trials attempt to evaluate multiple co-primary endpoints. In this study we present a power analysis method for CRTs with K â¥ 2 binary co-primary endpoints. It is developed based on the GEE (generalized estimating equation) approach, and three types of correlations are considered: inter-subject correlation within each endpoint, intra-subject correlation across endpoints, and inter-subject correlation across endpoints. A closed-form joint distribution of the K test statistics is derived, which facilitates the evaluation of power and type I error for arbitrarily constructed hypotheses. We further present a theorem that characterizes the relationship between various correlations and testing power. We assess the performance of the proposed power analysis method based on extensive simulation studies. An application example to a real clinical trial is presented.

The assessment of an existing prediction models using data with missing covariate values is challenging. In this article, we propose inverse probability weighted (IPW) and augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW) estimates of AUC and BS to handle the missing data. An alternative approach uses multiple imputation (MI), which requires a model for the distribution of the missing variable. We evaluated the performance of IPW and AIPW in comparison with MI in simulation studies under missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random scenarios. When there are missing observations in the data, MI and IPW can be used to obtain unbiased estimates of BS and AUC if the imputation model for the missing variable or the model for the missingness is correctly specified. MI is more efficient than IPW. Our simulation results suggest that AIPW can be more efficient than IPW, and also achieves double robustness from miss-specification of either the missingness model or the imputation model. The outcome variable should be included in the model for the missing variable under all scenarios, while it only needs to be included in missingness model if the missingness depends on the outcome. We illustrate these methods using an example from prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {Abstract We present a procedure for computing significance levels from data sets whose missing values have been multiply imputed data. This procedure uses moment-based statistics, m â¤ 3 repeated imputations, and an F reference distribution. When m = â, we show first that our procedure is essentially the same as the ideal procedure in cases of practical importance and, second, that its deviations from the ideal are basically a function of the coefficient of variation of the canonical ratios of complete to observed information. For small m our procedure's performance is largely governed by this coefficient of variation and the mean of these ratios. Using simulation techniques with small m, we compare our procedure's actual and nominal large-sample significance levels and conclude that it is essentially calibrated and thus represents a definite improvement over previously available procedures. Furthermore, we compare the large-sample power of the procedure as a function of m and other factors, such as the dimensionality of the estimand and fraction of missing information, to provide guidance on the choice of the number of imputations; generally, we find the loss of power due to small m to be quite modest in cases likely to occur in practice.},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems â false alarms, misses, and inversions â for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

  abstract = {In many orphan diseases and pediatric indications, the randomized controlled trials may be infeasible because of their size, duration, and cost. Leveraging information on the control through a prior can potentially reduce sample size. However, unless an objective prior is used to impose complete ignorance for the parameter being estimated, it results in biased estimates and inflated type-I error. Hence, it is essential to assess both the confirmatory and supplementary knowledge available during the construction of the prior to avoid âcherry-pickingâ advantageous information. For this purpose, propensity score methods are employed to minimize selection bias by weighting supplemental control subjects according to their similarity in terms of pretreatment characteristics to the subjects in the current trial. The latter can be operationalized through a proposed measure of overlap in propensity-score distributions. In this paper, we consider single experimental arm in the current trial and the control arm is completely borrowed from the supplemental data. The simulation experiments show that the proposed method reduces prior and data conflict and improves the precision of the of the average treatment effect.},

  abstract = {To increase power or reduce the number of patients needed for a parallel groups design, the crossover design has been often used to study treatments for noncurable chronic diseases. However, in the presence of carry-over effect caused by treatments, the commonly-used estimator which ignores the carry-over effect leads to a biased estimator for estimating the treatment effect difference. A two-stage test approach aimed to address carry-over effect proposed was found to be potentially misleading. In this paper, we propose a weighted average of the commonly-used estimator and an unbiased estimator that uses only the first period of the data. We derive an optimal weight that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) and its modified estimator. We apply Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators in a variety of situations. In the simulations, we examine the estimated MSE (EMSE), percentile interval length, and coverage probability calculated from the percentile intervals among considered estimators. Simulation results show that our proposed weighted average estimator and its modified estimator lead to smaller EMSEs on average comparing to the two commonly used estimators. The coverage probabilities using our proposed estimators are reasonably close to the nominal confidence level and the interval lengths are shorter comparing to the use of the unbiased estimator that uses only the first period of the data. We apply an example that was to evaluate the efficacy of two type of bronchodilators for asthma treatment to demonstrate the use of the proposed estimators.},

This makes it particularly appropriate for large clinical trials with ordinal response variables. In addition, when the trials are longitudinal, this model can be applied to individual responses instead of frequencies in contingency tables. Dependence can be incorporated by conditioning on the previous response, yielding a form of Markov chain. This approach is applied to the analysis of a large seasonal rhinitis trial, where patients were observed over 28 days and six symptoms recorded as ordinal responses.

In this t -approximation, Rubin and Schenker assume there are a finite number of multiple imputations, but an infinite number of observations in the sample. We propose a further degrees-of-freedom approximation which is a function of the within and between imputation variance, the number of multiple imputations, and the number of observations in the sample. When the number of observations in the sample is small, our approximate degrees-of-freedom may be more appropriate, as seen in our simulations.},

  abstract = {Medical studies increasingly involve a large sample of independent clusters, where the cluster sizes are also large. Our motivating example from the 2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) has 8,001,068 patients and 1049 clusters, with average cluster size of 7627. Consistent parameter estimates can be obtained naively assuming independence, which are inefficient when the intra-cluster correlation (ICC) is high. Efficient generalized estimating equations (GEE) incorporate the ICC and sum all pairs of observations within a cluster when estimating the ICC. For the 2010 NIS, there are 92.6 billion pairs of observations, making summation of pairs computationally prohibitive. We propose a one-step GEE estimator that (1) matches the asymptotic efficiency of the fully iterated GEE; (2) uses a simpler formula to estimate the ICC that avoids summing over all pairs; and (3) completely avoids matrix multiplications and inversions. These three features make the proposed estimator much less computationally intensive, especially with large cluster sizes. A unique contribution of this article is that it expresses the GEE estimating equations incorporating the ICC as a simple sum of vectors and scalars.},

Likelihood-based methods based on multivariate models for the data are useful tools for making efficient use of the available data, but standard models such as the multivariate normal imply linear additive relationships between the variables that may be too simplistic. We propose easily-fitted spline models that yield regression predictions that are more robust to nonlinearity in the relationship between the missing variables and the covariates, under MAR assumptions.

In recent years, physician performance scorecards have been used to provide feedback on individual measures; however, one key challenge is how to develop a composite quality index that combines multiple measures for overall physician performance evaluation. A controversy arises over establishing appropriate weights to combine indicators in multiple dimensions, and cannot be easily resolved. In this study, we proposed a generic unsupervised learning approach to develop a single composite index for physician performance assessment by using non-negative principal component analysis. We developed a new algorithm named iterative quadratic programming to solve the numerical issue in the non-negative principal component analysis approach. We conducted real case studies to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. We provided interpretations from both statistical and clinical perspectives to evaluate the developed composite ranking score in practice. In addition, we implemented the root cause assessment techniques to explain physician performance for improvement purposes.},

Large cohort studies provide valuable resources for building risk prediction models, as the risk factors are collected at the baseline and subjects are followed over time until disease occurrence or termination of the study. However, for rare diseases the baseline risk may not be estimated reliably based on cohort data only, due to sparse events. In this paper, we propose to make use of external information to improve efficiency for estimating time-dependent absolute risk. We derive the relationship between external disease incidence rates and the baseline risk, and incorporate the external disease incidence information into estimation of absolute risks, while allowing for potential difference of disease incidence rates between cohort and external sources. The asymptotic properties, namely, uniform consistency and weak convergence, of the proposed estimators are established. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator for absolute risk is more efficient than that based on the Breslow estimator, which does not utilize external disease incidence rates. A large cohort study, the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, is used to illustrate the proposed method.},

We propose a new estimation method for center effects which avoids including indicator variables for centers. We then show that center effects can be consistently estimated by the center-specific ratio of observed to expected cumulative numbers of events. We also consider the case where the recurrent event sequence can be stopped permanently by a terminating event. Large sample results are developed for the proposed estimators. We assess the finite-sample properties of the proposed estimators through simulation studies. The method is then applied to national hospital admissions data for end stage renal disease patients.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a Bayesian time-varying coefficient model to evaluate the temporal profile of intensity for multitype recurrent events. The model obtains smooth estimates for both time-varying coefficients and the baseline intensity using Bayesian penalized splines. One major challenge in Bayesian penalized splines is that the smoothness of a spline fit is sensitive to the subjective choice of hyperparameters. We establish a procedure to objectively determine the hyperparameters through robust prior specification. To effectively update the high-dimensional spline parameters, we develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure based on the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithms. A joint sampling scheme is used to achieve better convergence and mixing properties. A simulation study confirms satisfactory model performance in estimating time-varying coefficients under different curvature and event rate scenarios. Application to a commercial truck driver naturalistic driving data reveals that drivers with 7-hours-or-less sleep time have a significantly higher safety-critical event intensity after 8\,hr of driving and the intensity remains high after taking a break. The findings provide crucial information for the truck driver hours-of-service regulation and fatigue management. The proposed model provides a flexible and robust tool to evaluate the temporal profile of intensity for multitype recurrent events. Supplemental materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Targeted therapies tend to have biomarker defined subgroups that derive differential efficacy from treatments. This article corrects three prevailing oversights in stratified analyses comparing treatments in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with binary and time-to-event outcomes: 1.Using efficacy measures such as odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) can make a prognostic biomarker appear predictive, targeting wrong patients, because the inference is affected by a confounding/covert factor even with ignorable treatment assignment in an RCT. As shown analytically and with real immunotherapy patient level data, OR and HR cannot meet the causal Estimand requirement of ICH E9R1. 2.Mixing efficacy in subgroups by prevalence, the prevailing practice, can give misleading results also, for any efficacy measured as a ratio. However, mixing relative response (RR) and ratio of median (RoM) survival times by the prognostic effect, the confounding/covert factor hiding in plain sight, will give causal inference in an RCT. 3.Effects in subgroups should not be mixed on the logarithmic scale, because it creates an artificial Estimand for the whole population which changes depending on how the population is divided into subgroups. Current computer package implementations contain all these oversights. Probabilities, including survival curve probabilities, naturally average within each treatment arm by prevalence. The subgroup mixable estimation (SME) principle fixes the oversights by first averaging probabilities (not their logarithms) within each treatment arm, then computing simultaneous confidence intervals for ratio efficacy in subgroups and their mixtures based on rigorous mathematical derivation, to finally provide causal inference in the form of apps.},

  note = {The authors used loaded terms "correct" and "logical" in a cavalier fashion.~ They defined an efficacy measure as "logic-respecting" if the unstratified estimate is between the stratified estimates.~ There is no logic here, and this only points out that the authors think of the linear estimand space as magical.~ The authors seem to be believe that "population level efficacy" (Section 4.2, first paragraph) is of interest, and they do not acknowledge either that (1) this is not how clinical decisions are made, (2) populations may change, (3) population mixtures of patients who are candidates for therapy change over time, (4) RCTs do not need to have samples that are representative of populations, (5) neither sponsors nor regulators should be required to know covariate distributions in the ultimate target population, and (6) if proportional hazards holds in subgroups, it is impossible to hold in the combined sample, so envisioning a proportional hazards model for the whole sample is nonsensical.~ In the last two paragraphs of Section 4.2 the authors state that "Random assignments of treatments to patients in RCT designs needs to avoid bias not only in assessing" ... efficacy in the usual way but also when comparing patients in one stratum on treatment A with patients in another stratum on treatment B.~~ That may be the case but this kind of comparison, though implicitly involved in population-level contrasts, is of no interest to anyone.~ The authors go along to say at the end of this section "We feel that (the definition of)~ Estimand for efficacy in the whole population and in subgroups should be one and the same ... Makes no sense to define efficacy for the whole population that changes according to the subgroups it might get divided into." There is no logic to that. Just before Section 5 the authors mention the need for the strata distributions to be specified.~ These population distributions will not be known.~
\par
In Section 7.1.1 the authors engage in dichotomania and present a bogus analysis for effect modification due to a continuous biomarker.
\par
Section 8.1: This analysis is misleading.~ The authors do not realize that incomplete conditioning on the biomarker causes hidden heterogeneity within biomarker intervals.
\par
Commentary by Gene Pennelo and Dandan Xu: Section 5: "One lesson that can be learned from this analysis is that variables should not be dichotomized before they are analyzed... Indeed, when interaction between continuous bTMB and treatment is included in the Cox model, the p value is 0.9681, indicating no evidence that bTMB is predictive."~ Section 7: "nonlogic respecting of rankings of causal effect measures ... cannot arise provided that the causal effect measure mu is redefined in terms of the potential outcomes within a subject."~ Section 7.1 when focusing on ORs addresses the same point.~ Section 8: "In response to their provocative findings, we found that the odds and hazard ratios are logic respecting when the subgroups are purely predictive, that is, the distribution of potential outcome for the control treatment is homogeneous across subgroups.~ We also found that when we redefined the odds and hazard ratio causal estimands in terms of the joint distribution of the potential outcomes, the discrepancies are resolved under specific models in which the potential outcomes are conditionally independent."
\par
Commentary by Dong Xi and Frank Bretz: "This distinction [between conditional and marginal estimands] has been largely neglected in pharmaceutical drug development.~ For example, a marginal estimand for a binary outcome could be defined as a marginal odds ratio, which is a contrast of response probabilities obtained by averaging over the covariate space.~ On the other hand, a conditional estimand could be the treatment effect parameter in a standard logistic regression with covariates, which should be interpreted as an odds ratio conditioning on certain values of the covariates... It is neither right nor wrong to favour one estimand over another, much like one cannot favour apples over oranges... Both estimands allow for a causal interpretation in the sense of ICH (2019), and the choice between them should be guided by clinical meaningfulness of the resulting treatment effects."~ "... confounding and non-collapsibility are two separate issues".~ "... we believe that the collapsiblity of a measure of association defined by Huitfeldt et al (2019) and the logic-respecting definition are equivalent..."~ "It is useful to link SME with standardization (Hernan \& Robins, 2020, Section 2.3)..."~ "Based on the above steps, we can see that standardization uses the conditional regression model for a marginal estimand (Daniel et al 2021).~ It is closely related to the target maximum likelihood estimation and has a certain level of robustness to model misspecification in the conditional regression model under randomization (Moore \& van der Laan, 2009; Rosenblum \& van der Laan, 2010)."~ "Liu et al (2021) also considered the use of hazard ratios for time-to-event analysis.~ As argued by Sjolander et al (2016), the reason for non-collapsibility of hazard ratios is different than for odds ratios, because hazards are based on conditional probabilities on survival, and these cannot be averaged over covariates (Daniel et al, 2021).~ Moreover, for hazard ratios the estimand depends on the proportional hazard assumption; If it holds for both subgroups, it is almost always wrong for the overall.~ Without the proportional hazard assumption, however, the estimand of Cox model is a weighted average of hazard ratios over time, which is difficult to describe.~ This could be seen as a drawback on the primary analysis before looking at subgroups."
\par
Authors' rejoinder to commentaries:~ The authors did not address most of the criticisms contained in the two commentaries.~ The authors' rejoinder is not very logical as they emphasize caring what happens to patients but their methods are inconsistent with patient decision making.~ Their statement "We think in terms of clinical consequences, what benefits patients, what harms patients" is at odds with their statement "following nature to mix within each treatment arm first before calculating any efficacy measure between treatments resolves issues".}

The method is based on a variational approximation to a tractable augmented posterior and is faster than previous likelihood-based approaches. We use it to estimate drawable vine copulas for univariate and multivariate Markov ordinal and mixed time series. These have dimension rT, where T is the number of observations and r is the number of series, and are difficult to estimate using previous methods. The vine pair-copulas are carefully selected to allow for heteroscedasticity, which is a feature of most ordinal time series data. When combined with flexible margins, the resulting time series models also allow for other common features of ordinal data, such as zero inflation, multiple modes, and under or overdispersion. Using six example series, we illustrate both the flexibility of the time series copula models and the efficacy of the VB estimator for copulas of up to 792 dimensions and 60 parameters. This far exceeds the size and complexity of copula models for discrete data that can be estimated using previous methods. An online appendix and MATLAB code implementing the method are available as supplementary materials.},

Criteria for publication are based exclusively on the substantive importance of the research question addressed in the study, conveyed in the Introduction section of the manuscript, and the quality of the methodology, as reported in the Methods section. Practically, this policy is implemented by a two stage process whereby the editor initially distributes only the Introduction and Methods sections of a submitted manuscript to reviewers and a provisional decision regarding acceptance is made, followed by a second stage in which the complete manuscript is distributed for review but only if the decision of the first stage is for acceptance. The present paper expands upon this recommendation by addressing implications of this proposed policy with respect to statistical consultation and collaboration in research. It is suggested that under RBME, statisticians will become more integrated into research endeavors and called upon sooner for their input.},

In this article, we systematically evaluated the performance of three different models in longitudinal muscle spasm adverse event (AE) data obtained from a clinical trial for vismodegib: a proportional odds (PO) model, a discrete-time Markov model, and a continuous-time Markov model. All models developed based on weekly spaced data can reasonably capture the proportion of AE grade over time; however, the PO model overpredicted the transition frequency between grades and the cumulative probability of AEs. The influence of data frequency (daily, weekly, or unevenly spaced) was also investigated. The PO model performance reduced with increased data frequency, and the discrete-time Markov model failed to describe unevenly spaced data, but the continuous-time Markov model performed consistently well. Clinical trial simulations were conducted to illustrate the muscle spasm resolution time profile during the 8-week dose interruption period after 12 weeks of continuous treatment.},

The resulting parsimonious models will facilitate meaningful biological interpretation and scientific findings. Variable selection via Bayesian inference has been receiving significant advancement in recent years. Despite its increasing popularity, there is limited practical guidance for implementing these Bayesian approaches and evaluating their comparative performance in clinical datasets. In this paper, we review several commonly used Bayesian approaches to variable selection, with emphasis on application and implementation through R software. These approaches can be roughly categorized into four classes: namely the Bayesian model selection, spike-and-slab priors, shrinkage priors, and the hybrid of both. To evaluate their variable selection performance under various scenarios, we compare these four classes of approaches using real and simulated datasets. These results provide practical guidance to researchers who are interested in applying Bayesian approaches for the purpose of variable selection.},

  abstract = {Ordered categorical data arise in numerous settings, a common example being pain scores in analgesic trials. The modelling of such data is intrinsically more difficult than the modelling of continuous data due to the constraints on the underlying probabilities and the reduced amount of information that discrete outcomes contain. In this paper we discuss the class of cumulative logit models, which provide a natural framework for ordinal data analysis. We show how viewing the categorical outcome as the discretization of an underlying continuous response allows a natural interpretation of model parameters. We also show how covariates are incorporated into the model and how various types of correlation among repeated measures on the same individual may be accounted for. The models are illustrated using longitudinal allergy data consisting of sneezing scores measured on a four-point scale. Our approach throughout is Bayesian and we present a range of simple diagnostics to aid model building. Copyright Â© 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  note = {"Theoretical and empirical results indicate that the popular version of stratification via estimated propensity scores based on within-stratum sample mean differences and a fixed number of strata can lead to biased inference due to residual confounding, and the effect of this bias becomes more serious with increasing sample size. Using more strata can increase the sample size at which the trade-off of bias and variability involved in efficiency takes place, but stratifying on quintiles seems to be the most popular approach in practice, even for substantial sample sizes. Thus, as the trade-off point will be unknown for any specific problem, this approach should be used with caution. An interesting avenue for future research would be to establish guidelines for choosing the number of strata based on theoretical analysis of the rate at which the number of strata should increase with sample size to eliminate bias. A modification of stratification based instead on within-stratum regression estimates of treatment effect can eliminate this bias and achieve dramatic improvements in efficiency, but correct specification of the regression model is essential; otherwise, bias and degradation of performance can result. In this regard, this approach is similar to estimating causal effects via direct regression modelling but is less sensitive to mismodelling. Methods based on weighting are consistent and offer approximately unbiased inference for practical sample sizes. The semiparametric efficient estimator identified by the theory of Robins et al. [13], which incorporates regression modelling as a way to gain efficiency, also yields high precision. Although stratification based on regression and direct modelling can outperform this approach under some conditions, this estimator enjoys the unique 'double robustness' property in that it continues to lead to unbiased estimation of the average causal effect even if the regression models involved do not coincide with the true relationship, affording the analyst broad protection against misspecification not available with these other approaches. The results presented here support routine use of this estimator in practice."; nice derivations of inner workings of propensity score}

The objective in such a problem is often two-fold: both to explore the association structures of multiple sets of measurements and to develop a parsimonious model for predicting the future outcomes. We study a unified canonical variate regression framework to tackle the two problems simultaneously. The proposed criterion integrates multiple canonical correlation analysis with predictive modeling, balancing between the association strength of the canonical variates and their joint predictive power on the outcomes. Moreover, the proposed criterion seeks multiple sets of canonical variates simultaneously to enable the examination of their joint effects on the outcomes, and is able to handle multivariate and non-Gaussian outcomes. An efficient algorithm based on variable splitting and Lagrangian multipliers is proposed. Simulation studies show the superior performance of the proposed approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in an F\_2 intercross mice study and an alcohol dependence study.},

However, the health status progression across time is not typically observed directly: records are observed only when a subject interacts with the system, yielding irregular and often sparse observations. This suggests that the observed trajectories should be modeled via a latent continuous-time process potentially as a function of time-varying covariates. We develop a continuous-time hidden Markov model to analyze longitudinal data accounting for irregular visits and different types of observations. By employing a specific missing data likelihood formulation, we can construct an efficient computational algorithm. We focus on Bayesian inference for the model: this is facilitated by an expectation-maximization algorithm and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Simulation studies demonstrate that these approaches can be implemented efficiently for large data sets in a fully Bayesian setting. We apply this model to a real cohort where patients suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with the outcome being the number of drugs taken, using health care utilization indicators and patient characteristics as covariates.},

To understand this a history on the speed of light up to the time of Michelsonâs study is presented. The larger history and the details of a single study allow us to place the method of statistics within the larger context of science.},

Then, the sample size and the study duration derived from the required number of events are considered; however, their combination is not uniquely determined. In practice, various combinations are examined considering the enrollment speed, study duration, and the cost of enrollment. However, effective methods for visually representing their relationships and evaluating the uncertainty in study duration are insufficient. We developed a graphical approach for examining the relationship between sample size and study duration. To evaluate the uncertainty in study duration under a given sample size, we also derived the probability density function of the study duration and a method for updating the probability density function according to the observed number of events (ie, information time). The proposed methods are expected to improve the operation and management of clinical trials with a time-to-event endpoint.},

Traditional applications usually consider data with only a small numbers of predictors with a few hundreds or thousands of observations. Recent advances in data acquisition techniques and computation power have led to considerable interest in analyzing very-high-dimensional data where the number of predictor variables and the number of observations range between 10 4 and 10 6. In this paper, we present a tool for performing large-scale regularized parametric survival analysis using a variant of the cyclic coordinate descent method. Through our experiments on two real data sets, we show that application of regularized models to high-dimensional data avoids overfitting and can provide improved predictive performance and calibration over corresponding low-dimensional models.},

We aimed to provide guidance for drawing conclusions from data with a large proportion of missingness. Study Design and Setting Via simulations, we investigated how the proportion of missing data, the fraction of missing information (FMI), and availability of auxiliary variables affected MI performance. Outcome data were missing completely at random or missing at random (MAR). Results Provided sufficient auxiliary information was available; MI was beneficial in terms of bias and never detrimental in terms of efficiency. Models with similar FMI values, but differing proportions of missing data, also had similar precision for effect estimates. In the absence of bias, the FMI was a better guide to the efficiency gains using MI than the proportion of missing data. Conclusion We provide evidence that for MAR data, valid MI reduces bias even when the proportion of missingness is large. We advise researchers to use FMI to guide choice of auxiliary variables for efficiency gain in imputation analyses, and that sensitivity analyses including different imputation models may be needed if the number of complete cases is small.},

  abstract = {Medical research often involves using multi-item scales to assess individual characteristics, disease severity, and other health-related outcomes. It is common to observe missing data in the scale scores, due to missing data in one or more items that make up that score. Multiple imputation (MI) is a popular method for handling missing data. However, it is not clear how best to use MI in the context of scale scores, particularly when they are assessed at multiple waves of data collection resulting in large numbers of items. The aim of this article is to provide practical advice on how to impute missing values in a repeatedly measured multi-item scale using MI when inference on the scale score is of interest. We evaluated the performance of five MI strategies for imputing missing data at either the item or scale level using simulated data and a case study based on four waves of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). MI was implemented using both multivariate normal imputation and fully conditional specification, with two rules for calculating the scale score. A complete case analysis was also performed for comparison. Based on our results, we caution against the use of a MI strategy that does not include the scale score in the imputation model(s) when the scale score is required for analysis.},

  abstract = {Polygenic scores (PGS) summarize the genetic contribution of a person's genotype to a disease or phenotype. They can be used to group participants into different risk categories for diseases, and are also used as covariates in epidemiological analyses. A number of possible ways of calculating PGS have been proposed, and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate information available in published summary statistics. As there is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in summary statistics, a pertinent question is how we can use LD information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To answer this question, we propose a method for constructing PGS using summary statistics and a reference panel in a penalized regression framework, which we call lassosum. We also propose a general method for choosing the value of the tuning parameter in the absence of validation data. In our simulations, we showed that pseudovalidation often resulted in prediction accuracy that is comparable to using a dataset with validation phenotype and was clearly superior to the conservative option of setting the tuning parameter of lassosum to its lowest value. We also showed that lassosum achieved better prediction accuracy than simple clumping and P-value thresholding in almost all scenarios. It was also substantially faster and more accurate than the recently proposed LDpred.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Many exposures of epidemiological interest are time varying, and the values of potential confounders may change over time leading to time varying confounding. The aim of many longitudinal studies is to estimate the causal effect of a time varying exposure on an outcome that requires adjusting for time varying confounding. Time varying confounding affected by previous exposure often occurs in practice, but it is usually adjusted for by using conventional analytical methods such as time dependent Cox regression, random effects models, or generalised estimating equations, which are known to provide biased effect estimates in this setting. This article explains time varying confounding affected by previous exposure and outlines three causal methods proposed to appropriately adjust for this potential bias: inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting, the parametric G formula, and G estimation\emph{.}{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The restricted mean time in favor (RMT-IF) of treatment is a nonparametric effect size for complex life history data. It is defined as the net average time the treated spend in a more favorable state than the untreated over a pre-specified time window. It generalizes the familiar restricted mean survival time from the two-state life-death model to account for intermediate stages in disease progression. The overall estimand can be additively decomposed into stage-wise effects, with the standard restricted mean survival time as a component. Alternate expressions of the overall and stage-wise estimands as integrals of the marginal survival functions for a sequence of landmark transitioning events allow them to be easily estimated by plug-in KaplanâMeier estimators. The dynamic profile of the estimated treatment effects as a function of follow-up time can be visualized using a multilayer, cone-shaped âbouquet plotâ. Simulation studies under realistic settings show that the RMT-IF meaningfully and accurately quantifies the treatment effect and outperforms traditional tests on time to the first event in statistical efficiency thanks to its fuller utilization of patient data. The new methods are illustrated on a colon cancer trial with relapse and death as outcomes and a cardiovascular trial with recurrent hospitalizations and death as outcomes.

  abstract = {Summary. Following several recent inquiries in the UK into medical malpractice and failures to deliver appropriate standards of health care, there is pressure to introduce formal monitoring of performance outcomes routinely throughout the National Health Service. Statistical process control (SPC) charts have been widely used to monitor medical outcomes in a variety of contexts and have been specifically advocated for use in clinical governance. However, previous applications of SPC charts in medical monitoring have focused on surveillance of a single process over time. We consider some of the methodological and practical aspects that surround the routine surveillance of health outcomes and, in particular, we focus on two important methodological issues that arise when attempting to extend SPC charts to monitor outcomes at more than one unit simultaneously (where a unit could be, for example, a surgeon, general practitioner or hospital): the need to acknowledge the inevitable between-unit variation in âacceptableâ performance outcomes due to the net effect of many small unmeasured sources of variation (e.g. unmeasured case mix and data errors) and the problem of multiple testing over units as well as time. We address the former by using quasi-likelihood estimates of overdispersion, and the latter by using recently developed methods based on estimation of false discovery rates. We present an application of our approach to annual monitoring âall-causeâ mortality data between 1995 and 2000 from 169 National Health Service hospital trusts in England and Wales.},

In problems where the true regression function is sparse and the signals large, such cross-validation typically works well. However, in regression modeling of genomic studies involving Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), the true regression functions, while thought to be sparse, do not have large signals. We demonstrate empirically that in such problems, the number of selected variables using SCAD and the Adaptive Lasso, with 10-fold cross-validation, is a random variable that has considerable and surprising variation. Similar remarks apply to non-oracle methods such as the Lasso. Our study strongly questions the suitability of performing only a single run of m-fold cross-validation with any oracle method, and not just the SCAD and Adaptive Lasso.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among patients with stable coronary disease and moderate or severe ischemia, whether clinical outcomes are better in those who receive an invasive intervention plus medical therapy than in those who receive medical therapy alone is uncertain. METHODS: We randomly assigned 5179 patients with moderate or severe ischemia to an initial invasive strategy (angiography and revascularization when feasible) and medical therapy or to an initial conservative strategy of medical therapy alone and angiography if medical therapy failed. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. A key secondary outcome was death from cardiovascular causes or myocardial infarction. RESULTS: Over a median of 3.2 years, 318 primary outcome events occurred in the invasive-strategy group and 352 occurred in the conservative-strategy group. At 6 months, the cumulative event rate was 5.3\% in the invasive-strategy group and 3.4\% in the conservative-strategy group (difference, 1.9 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.8 to 3.0); at 5 years, the cumulative event rate was 16.4\% and 18.2\%, respectively (difference, -1.8 percentage points; 95\% CI, -4.7 to 1.0). Results were similar with respect to the key secondary outcome. The incidence of the primary outcome was sensitive to the definition of myocardial infarction; a secondary analysis yielded more procedural myocardial infarctions of uncertain clinical importance. There were 145 deaths in the invasive-strategy group and 144 deaths in the conservative-strategy group (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.83 to 1.32). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with stable coronary disease and moderate or severe ischemia, we did not find evidence that an initial invasive strategy, as compared with an initial conservative strategy, reduced the risk of ischemic cardiovascular events or death from any cause over a median of 3.2 years. The trial findings were sensitive to the definition of myocardial infarction that was used.

  abstract = {To ensure that a study can properly address its research aims, the sample size and power must be determined appropriately. Covariate adjustment via regression modeling permits more precise estimation of the effect of a primary variable of interest at the expense of increased complexity in sample size/power calculation. The presence of correlation between the main variable and other covariates, commonly seen in observational studies and non-randomized clinical trials, further complicates this process. Though sample size and power specification methods have been obtained to accommodate specific covariate distributions and models, most existing approaches rely on either simple approximations lacking theoretical support or complex procedures that are difficult to apply at the design stage. The current literature lacks a general, coherent theory applicable to a broader class of regression models and covariate distributions. We introduce succinct formulas for sample size and power determination with the generalized linear, Cox, and Fine-Gray models that account for correlation between a main effect and other covariates. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this method produces studies that are appropriately sized to meet their type I error rate and power specifications, particularly offering accurate sample size/power estimation in the presence of correlated covariates.},

There are a number of procedures for performing battery reduction analysis. A popular method involves first performing a principal components analysis to select m components, which account for the salient variance in the original data. GramâSchmidt orthogonal rotations are then performed to determine the m variables that account for the largest proportion of variance. The procedure is illustrated and reference made to a SAS macro for performing the analysis.},

  abstract = {Stepped wedge designs (SWDs) have received considerable attention recently, as they are potentially a useful way to assess new treatments in areas such as health services implementation. Because allocation is usually by cluster, SWDs are often viewed as a form of cluster-randomized trial. However, since the treatment within a cluster changes during the course of the study, they can also be viewed as a form of crossover design. This article explores SWDs from the perspective of crossover trials and designed experiments more generally. We show that the treatment effect estimator in a linear mixed effects model can be decomposed into a weighted mean of the estimators obtained from (1) regarding an SWD as a conventional row-column design and (2) a so-called vertical analysis, which is a row-column design with row effects omitted. This provides a precise representation of â horizontalâ and â verticalâ comparisons, respectively, which to date have appeared without formal description in the literature. This decomposition displays a sometimes surprising way the analysis corrects for the partial confounding between time and treatment effects. The approach also permits the quantification of the loss of efficiency caused by mis-specifying the correlation parameter in the mixed-effects model. Optimal extensions of the vertical analysis are obtained, and these are shown to be highly inefficient for values of the within-cluster dependence that are likely to be encountered in practice. Some recently described extensions to the classic SWD incorporating multiple treatments are also compared using the experimental design framework.},

  abstract = {The success of the first edition of Generalized Linear Models led to the updated Second Edition, which continues to provide a definitive unified, treatment of methods for the analysis of diverse types of data. Today, it remains popular for its clarity, richness of content and direct relevance to agricultural, biological, health, engineering, and other applications.The authors focus on examining the way a response variable depends on a combination of explanatory variables, treatment, and classification variables. They give particular emphasis to the important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown, linear combination of the explanatory variables.The Second Edition includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations, and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was expanded and incorporates significant revisions.Comprehension of the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book is self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples, plentiful exercises, and topics of direct use to researchers in many disciplines, Generalized Linear Models serves as ideal text, self-study guide, and reference.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Quality and outcomes registry platforms lie at the center of many emerging evidence-driven reform models. Specifically, clinical registry data are progressively informing health care decision-making. In this analysis, the authors used data from a national prospective outcomes registry (the Quality Outcomes Database) to develop a predictive model for 12-month postoperative pain, disability, and quality of life (QOL) in patients undergoing elective lumbar spine surgery. METHODS Included in this analysis were 7618 patients who had completed 12 months of follow-up. The authors prospectively assessed baseline and 12-month patient-reported outcomes (PROs) via telephone interviews. The PROs assessed were those ascertained using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), EQ-5D, and numeric rating scale (NRS) for back pain (BP) and leg pain (LP). Variables analyzed for the predictive model included age, gender, body mass index, race, education level, history of prior surgery, smoking status, comorbid conditions, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, symptom duration, indication for surgery, number of levels surgically treated, history of fusion surgery, surgical approach, receipt of workers' compensation, liability insurance, insurance status, and ambulatory ability. To create a predictive model, each 12-month PRO was treated as an ordinal dependent variable and a separate proportional-odds ordinal logistic regression model was fitted for each PRO. RESULTS There was a significant improvement in all PROs (p {$<$} 0.0001) at 12 months following lumbar spine surgery. The most important predictors of overall disability, QOL, and pain outcomes following lumbar spine surgery were employment status, baseline NRS-BP scores, psychological distress, baseline ODI scores, level of education, workers' compensation status, symptom duration, race, baseline NRS-LP scores, ASA score, age, predominant symptom, smoking status, and insurance status. The prediction discrimination of the 4 separate novel predictive models was good, with a c-index of 0.69 for ODI, 0.69 for EQ-5D, 0.67 for NRS-BP, and 0.64 for NRS-LP (i.e., good concordance between predicted outcomes and observed outcomes). CONCLUSIONS This study found that preoperative patient-specific factors derived from a prospective national outcomes registry significantly influence PRO measures of treatment effectiveness at 12 months after lumbar surgery. Novel predictive models constructed with these data hold the potential to improve surgical effectiveness and the overall value of spine surgery by optimizing patient selection and identifying important modifiable factors before a surgery even takes place. Furthermore, these models can advance patient-focused care when used as shared decision-making tools during preoperative patient counseling.},

  abstract = {The use of the proportional odds (PO) model for ordinal regression is ubiquitous in the literature. If the assumption of parallel lines does not hold for the data, then an alternative is to specify a non-proportional odds (NPO) model, where the regression parameters are allowed to vary depending on the level of the response. However, it is often difficult to fit these models, and challenges regarding model choice and fitting are further compounded if there are a large number of explanatory variables. We make two contributions towards tackling these issues: firstly, we develop a Bayesian method for fitting these models, that ensures the stochastic ordering conditions hold for an arbitrary finite range of the explanatory variables, allowing NPO models to be fitted to any observed data set. Secondly, we use reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to allow the model to choose between PO and NPO structures for each explanatory variable, and show how variable selection can be incorporated. These methods can be adapted for any monotonic increasing link functions. We illustrate the utility of these approaches on novel data from a longitudinal study of individual-level risk factors affecting body condition score in a dog population in Zenzele, South Africa.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a model, with assumptions similar to those of the linear model, for use when the observed dependent variable is ordinal. This model is an extension of the dichotomous probit model, and assumes that the ordinal nature of the observed dependent variable is due to methodological limitations in collecting the data, which force the researcher to lump together and identify various portions of an (otherwise) interval level variable. The model assumes a linear eflect of each independent variable as well as a series of break points between categories for the dependent variable. Maximum likelihood estimators are found for these parameters, along with their asymptotic sampling distributions, and an analogue of R 2 (the coefficient of determination in regression analysis) is defined to measure goodness of fit. The use of the model is illustrated with an analysis of Congressional voting on the 1965 Medicare Bill.},

While the ASA Statement notes that statistical significance and p-values are ?commonly misused and misinterpreted,? it does not discuss and document broader implications of these errors for the interpretation of evidence. In this article, we review research on how applied researchers who are not primarily statisticians misuse and misinterpret p-values in practice and how this can lead to errors in the interpretation of evidence. We also present new data showing, perhaps surprisingly, that researchers who are primarily statisticians are also prone to misuse and misinterpret p-values thus resulting in similar errors. In particular, we show that statisticians tend to interpret evidence dichotomously based on whether or not a p-value crosses the conventional 0.05 threshold for statistical significance. We discuss implications and offer recommendations.},

At the design stage, it is often assumed that the treatment hazard ratio (HR) is constant across the strata, and the data are commonly analyzed using the stratified Cox proportional hazards model. We caution that this ubiquitous approach is needlessly risky because departures from the assumption of the HR being the same for all the strata can result in a notably biased and/or less powerful analysis. An alternative approach is proposed in which first the [log] HR is estimated separately for each stratum using an unstratified Cox model, and then the stratum-specific estimates are combined for overall inference using either sample size or 'minimum risk' stratum weights. The advantages of the proposed two-step analysis versus the common one-step stratified Cox model analysis are illustrated using simulations that were conducted to support the design of a vaccine clinical trial.},

  abstract = {Randomized experiments have enormous potential to improve human welfare in many domains, including healthcare, education, finance, and public policy. However, such âA/B testsâ are often criticized on ethical grounds even as similar, untested interventions are implemented without objection. We find robust evidence across 16 studies of 5,873 participants from three diverse populations spanning nine domainsâfrom healthcare to autonomous vehicle design to poverty reductionâthat people frequently rate A/B tests designed to establish the comparative effectiveness of two policies or treatments as inappropriate even when universally implementing either A or B, untested, is seen as appropriate. This âA/B effectâ is as strong among those with higher educational attainment and science literacy and among relevant professionals. It persists even when there is no reason to prefer A to B and even when recipients are treated unequally and randomly in all conditions (A, B, and A/B). Several remaining explanations for the effectâa belief that consent is required to impose a policy on half of a population but not on the entire population; an aversion to controlled but not to uncontrolled experiments; and a proxy form of the illusion of knowledge (according to which randomized evaluations are unnecessary because experts already do or should know âwhat worksâ)âappear to contribute to the effect, but none dominates or fully accounts for it. We conclude that rigorously evaluating policies or treatments via pragmatic randomized trials may provoke greater objection than simply implementing those same policies or treatments untested.},

METHODS: Serum NRG was measured by ELISA in 248 patients with NYHA class I-IV HF. RESULTS: NRG exhibited a marginally significant effect on LVEF trajectory over 11\,months (p\,=\,0.07). There is no apparent level of NRG that predicts improved survival.

  abstract = {When a ranking of institutions such as medical centers or universities is based on a numerical measure of performance provided with a standard error, confidence intervals (CIs) should be calculated to assess the uncertainty of these ranks. We present a novel method based on Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) test to construct simultaneous CIs for the true ranks. When all the true performances are equal, the probability of coverage of our method attains the nominal level. In case the true performance measures have no exact ties, our method is conservative. For this situation, we propose a rescaling method to the nominal level which results in shorter CIs while keeping control of the simultaneous coverage. We also show that a similar rescaling can be applied to correct a recently proposed Monte-Carlo based method which is anticonservative. After rescaling, the two methods perform very similarly. However, the rescaling of the Monte-Carlo based method is computationally much more demanding and becomes infeasible when the number of institutions is larger than 30 to 50. We discuss another recently proposed method similar to ours based on simultaneous CIs for the true performance. We show that our method provides uniformly shorter CIs for the same confidence level. We illustrate the superiority of our new methods with a data analysis for travel time to work in the U.S. and on rankings of 64 hospitals in the Netherlands.},

  abstract = {Accurate identification of atrial fibrillation episodes from polysomnograms is important for research purposes but requires manual review of a large number of long electrocardiographic tracings. As automated assessment of these tracings for atrial fibrillation may improve efficiency, this study aimed to evaluate this approach in polysomnogram-derived electrocardiographic data. A previously described algorithm to detect atrial fibrillation from single-lead electrocardiograms was applied to polysomnograms from a large epidemiologic study of obstructive sleep apnea in older men (Osteoporotic Fractures in Men [MrOS] Sleep Study). Atrial fibrillation status during each participant's PSG was determined by independent manual review. Models to predict atrial fibrillation status from a combination of algorithm output and clinical/polysomnographic characteristics were developed, and their accuracy was evaluated using standard statistical techniques. Derivation and validation cohorts each consisted of 1395 individuals; 5~\% of each group had atrial fibrillation. Model parameters were optimized for the derivation cohort using the Akaike information criterion. Application to the validation cohort of these optimized models revealed high sensitivity (85-90~\%) and specificity (90-95~\%) as well as good predictive ability, as assessed by the C statistic ({$>$}0.9) and generalized R (2) values (â¼0.6). Addition of cardiovascular or polysomnogram data to the models did not improve their performance. In a research setting, automated detection of atrial fibrillation from polysomnogram-derived electrocardiographic signals appears feasible and agrees well with manual identification. Future studies can evaluate the utility of this technique as applied to clinical polysomnograms and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring.},

Using the management of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma as our motivating example, we explain the role of prognostic covariates that characterize between-patient heterogeneity in clinical outcomes. We show that explicitly specifying the joint utility of clinical outcomes provides a coherent basis for patient-specific decision-making.},

  abstract = {Suppose that a heterogeneous group of individuals is followed over time and that each individual can be in state 0 or state 1 at each time point. The sequence of states is assumed to follow a binary Markov chain. In this paper we model the transition probabilities for the 0 to 0 and 1 to 0 transitions by two logistic regressions, thus showing how the covariates relate to changes in state. With p covariates, there are 2(p + 1) parameters including intercepts, which we estimate by maximum likelihood. We show how to use transition probability estimates to test hypotheses about the probability of occupying state 0 at time i (i = 2, ..., T) and the equilibrium probability of state 0. These probabilities depend on the covariates. A recursive algorithm is suggested to estimate regression coefficients when some responses are missing. Extensions of the basic model which allow time-dependent covariates and nonstationary or second-order Markov chains are presented. An example shows the model applied to a study of the psychological impact of breast cancer in which women did or did not manifest distress at four time points in the year following surgery.},

Most of the 866 patients enrolled in our multicenter study underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring and determination of the resting radionuclide ventricular ejection fraction before discharge. Univariate analyses showed a progressive increase in cardiac mortality during one year as the ejection fraction fell below 0.40 and as the number of ventricular ectopic depolarizations exceeded one per hour. Only four risk factors among eight prespecified variables were independent predictors of mortality: an ejection fraction below 0.40, ventricular ectopy of 10 or more depolarizations per hour, advanced New York Heart Association functional class before infarction, and rales heard in the upper two thirds of the lung fields while the patient was in the coronary-care unit. Various combinations of these four factors identified five risk subgroups with two-year mortality rates ranging from 3 per cent (no factors) to 60 per cent (all four factors).},

  abstract = {Purpose: GI-4000, a series of recombinant yeast expressing four different mutated RAS proteins, was evaluated in subjects with resected ras-mutated pancreas cancer.Methods: Subjects (n\,=\,176) received GI-4000 or placebo plus gemcitabine. Subjects' tumors were genotyped to identify which matched GI-4000 product to administer. Immune responses were measured by interferon-Î³ (IFNÎ³) ELISpot assay and by regulatory T cell (Treg) frequencies on treatment. Pretreatment plasma was retrospectively analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry for proteomic signatures predictive of GI-4000 responsiveness.Results: GI-4000 was well tolerated, with comparable safety findings between treatment groups. The GI-4000 group showed a similar pattern of median recurrence-free and overall survival (OS) compared with placebo. For the prospectively defined and stratified R1 resection subgroup, there was a trend in 1 year OS (72\% vs. 56\%), an improvement in OS (523.5 vs. 443.5 days [hazard ratio (HR)\,=\,1.06 [confidence interval (CI): 0.53â2.13], p\,=\,0.872), and increased frequency of immune responders (40\% vs. 8\%; p\,=\,0.062) for GI-4000 versus placebo and a 159-day improvement in OS for R1 GI-4000 immune responders versus placebo (p\,=\,0.810). For R0 resection subjects, no increases in IFNÎ³ responses in GI-4000âtreated subjects were observed. A higher frequency of R0/R1 subjects with a reduction in Tregs (CD4+/CD45RA+/Foxp3low) was observed in GI-4000âtreated subjects versus placebo (p\,=\,0.033). A proteomic signature was identified that predicted response to GI-4000/gemcitabine regardless of resection status.Conclusion: These results justify continued investigation of GI-4000 in studies stratified for likely responders or in combination with immune check-point inhibitors or other immunomodulators, which may provide optimal reactivation of antitumor immunity.ClinicalTrials.gov Number: NCT00300950.},

The simplicity achieved by creating â¥2 artificial groups has a cost: Grouping may create rather than avoid problems. In particular, dichotomization leads to a considerable loss of power and incomplete correction for confounding factors. The use of data-derived "optimal" cut-points can lead to serious bias and should at least be tested on independent observations to assess their validity. Both problems are illustrated by the way the results of a registry on unruptured intracranial aneurysms are commonly used. Extreme caution should restrict the application of such results to clinical decision-making. Categorization of continuous data, especially dichotomization, is unnecessary for statistical analysis. Continuous explanatory variables should be left alone in statistical models.},

One of the panel discussions concerned the use of composite outcomes in heart failure trials. With use of composite outcomes, event rates are higher and if it is reasonable to assume that the treatment effect is similar for each component of the composite outcome, sample size will be smaller than using one of the components as the primary end point. Composites end points are difficult to interpret if effects are not similar for all components or if the effect of treatment is primarily on a more common, less serious component of the composite. Composite outcomes typically only focus on the first occurring event. This can lead to a substantial loss of information in some trials. When composite end points are used, data collection for all components should continue until the end of the trial so that each component can be separately evaluated.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusion{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Composite end points should be used with caution.

  abstract = {Determining the sample size of an experiment can be challenging, even more so when incorporating external information via a prior distribution. Such information is increasingly used to reduce the size of the control group in randomized clinical trials. Knowing the amount of prior information, expressed as an equivalent prior effective sample size (ESS), clearly facilitates trial designs. Various methods to obtain a prior's ESS have been proposed recently. They have been justified by the fact that they give the standard ESS for one-parameter exponential families. However, despite being based on similar information-based metrics, they may lead to surprisingly different ESS for non-conjugate settings, which complicates many designs with prior information. We show that current methods fail a basic predictive consistency criterion, which requires the expected posteriorâpredictive ESS for a sample of size N to be the sum of the prior ESS and N. The expected local-information-ratio ESS is introduced and shown to be predictively consistent. It corrects the ESS of current methods, as shown for normally distributed data with a heavy-tailed Student-t prior and exponential data with a generalized Gamma prior. Finally, two applications are discussed: the prior ESS for the control group derived from historical data, and the posterior ESS for hierarchical subgroup analyses.

These models are well studied for right censored outcomes and are typically used in survival analysis. We consider transformation models as a tool for situations with uncensored continuous outcomes where linear regression is not appropriate. We introduce the probabilistic index as a uniform effect measure for the class of transformation models. We discuss and compare three estimators using a working Cox regression model: the partial likelihood estimator, an estimator based on binary generalized linear models and one based on probabilistic index model estimating equations. The latter has a superior performance in terms of bias and variance when the working model is misspecified. For the purpose of illustration, we analyze data that were collected at an urban alcohol and drug detoxification unit.},

  abstract = {So-called nonparametric statistical methods are often in fact based on population parameters, which can be estimated (with confidence limits) using the corresponding sample statistics. This article reviews the uses of three such parameters, namely Kendalls Somers D, and the Hodges-Lehmann median difference. Confidence intervals for these are demonstrated using the somersd package. It is argued that confidence limits for these parameters, and their differences, are more informative than the traditional practice of reporting only p-values. These three parameters are also important in defining other tests and parameters, such as the Wilcoxon test, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Harrells C, and the Theil median slope.},

The authors' approach is based on many years of experience teaching physicians in a clinical research training program. Although requiring only a minimum of mathematics knowledge, the quantitative discussions in this book are deeper and more rigorous than in most introductory texts. The book includes numerous worked examples and 60 problems (with answers) based on real clinical situations and journal articles. The book will be helpful and accessible to anyone seeking to select, develop, or market medical tests. Topics covered include: the diagnostic process, test reliability and accuracy, likelihood ratios, and ROC curves, testing and treatment thresholds, critical appraisal of studies of diagnostic, screening and prognostic tests, test independence and methods of combining tests, quantifying treatment benefits using randomized trials and observational studies, Bayesian interpretation of P values and confidence intervals and challenges for evidence-based diagnosis and evidence-based medicine.},

  abstract = {The field of precision medicine aims to tailor treatment based on patient-specific factors in a reproducible way. To this end, estimating an optimal individualized treatment regime (ITR) that recommends treatment decisions based on patient characteristics to maximize the mean of a pre-specified outcome is of particular interest. Several methods have been proposed for estimating an optimal ITR from clinical trial data in the parallel group setting where each subject is randomized to a single intervention. However, little work has been done in the area of estimating the optimal ITR from crossover study designs. Such designs naturally lend themselves to precision medicine, because they allow for observing the response to multiple treatments for each patient. In this paper, we introduce a method for estimating the optimal ITR using data from a 2 Ã 2 crossover study with or without carryover effects. The proposed method is similar to policy search methods such as outcome weighted learning (OWL); however, we take advantage of the crossover design by using the difference in responses under each treatment as the observed reward. We establish Fisher and global consistency, present numerical experiments, and analyze data from a feeding trial to demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method compared to standard methods for a parallel study design.

  abstract = {A time-dependent measure, termed the rate ratio, was proposed to assess the local dependence between two types of recurrent event processes in one-sample settings. However, the one-sample work does not consider modelling the dependence by covariates such as subject characteristics and treatments received. The focus of this paper is to understand how and in what magnitude the covariates influence the dependence strength for bivariate recurrent events. We propose the covariate-adjusted rate ratio, a measure of covariate-adjusted dependence. We propose a semiparametric regression model for jointly modeling the frequency and dependence of bivariate recurrent events: the first level is a proportional rates model for the marginal rates and the second level is a proportional rate ratio model for the dependence structure. We develop a pseudo-partial likelihood to estimate the parameters in the proportional rate ratio model. We establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators and evaluate the finite sample performance via simulation studies. We illustrate the proposed models and methods using a soft tissue sarcoma study that examines the effects of initial treatments on the marginal frequencies of local/distant sarcoma recurrence and the dependence structure between the two types of cancer recurrence.

  abstract = {In assessing prediction accuracy of multivariable prediction models, optimism corrections are essential for preventing biased results. However, in most published papers of clinical prediction models, the point estimates of the prediction accuracy measures are corrected by adequate bootstrap-based correction methods, but their confidence intervals are not corrected, for example, the DeLong's confidence interval is usually used for assessing the C-statistic. These naÃ¯ve methods do not adjust for the optimism bias and do not account for statistical variability in the estimation of parameters in the prediction models. Therefore, their coverage probabilities of the true value of the prediction accuracy measure can be seriously below the nominal level (eg, 95\%). In this article, we provide two generic bootstrap methods, namely, (1) location-shifted bootstrap confidence intervals and (2) two-stage bootstrap confidence intervals, that can be generally applied to the bootstrap-based optimism correction methods, that is, the Harrell's bias correction, 0.632, and 0.632+ methods. In addition, they can be widely applied to various methods for prediction model development involving modern shrinkage methods such as the ridge and lasso regressions. Through numerical evaluations by simulations, the proposed confidence intervals showed favorable coverage performances. Besides, the current standard practices based on the optimism-uncorrected methods showed serious undercoverage properties. To avoid erroneous results, the optimism-uncorrected confidence intervals should not be used in practice, and the adjusted methods are recommended instead. We also developed the R package predboot for implementing these methods ( https://github.com/nomahi/predboot). The effectiveness of the proposed methods are illustrated via applications to the GUSTO-I clinical trial.},

  abstract = {A Bayesian approach to variable selection which is based on the expected KullbackâLeibler divergence between the full model and its projection onto a submodel has recently been suggested in the literature. For generalized linear models an extension of this idea is proposed by considering projections onto subspaces defined via some form of L1L1 constraint on the parameter in the full model. This leads to Bayesian model selection approaches related to the lasso. In the posterior distribution of the projection there is positive probability that some components are exactly zero and the posterior distribution on the model space induced by the projection allows exploration of model uncertainty. Use of the approach in structured variable selection problems such as ANOVA models is also considered, where it is desired to incorporate main effects in the presence of interactions. Projections related to the non-negative garotte are able to respect the hierarchical constraints. A consistency result is given concerning the posterior distribution on the model induced by the projection, showing that for some projections related to the adaptive lasso and non-negative garotte the posterior distribution concentrates on the true model asymptotically.},

  note = {"Only 26\% of the studies attempted independent validation or cross-validation of their proposed findings. ... 18 studies used cross-validation (eight complete, eight incomplete, and two both). Of the nine studies that used cross-validation for major clinical outcomes, one used complete cross-validation, seven used incomplete forms of cross-validation, and one used both. ... several modelling approaches were also tested, with comparable or slightly worse error rates than the eventually preferred approach presented as the main analysis. Sotiriou and colleagues probably used the same genes in all cross-validation sets, although this point is unclear. van't Veer and colleagues did both complete and incomplete cross-validations, focusing primarily on the results of the incomplete cross-validation (for the same genes each time), but the error rate was higher ... in the complete cross-validation. Three other groups ... also selected among several gene models the ones with best performance in cross-validation. ... However the best performance was seen in four small datasets ... the odds of reaching a formally significant association increased 3.5 times ... per doubling of sample size and 9.7 times ... per ten-fold increase in the number of probes. ... A study on lung adenocarcinoma found that unsupervised DNA microarray analysis predicted death with a sensitivity of 38\% and a specificity of 81\%. Cross-validation of supervised modelling gave 71\% sensitivity and 66\% specificity. In two independent validations, the sensitivity was 64\% and 50\%, with specificity 63\% and 64\%, respectively. ... We assessed 84 DNA microarray studies addressing important clinical issues on cancer outcomes and correlates. The predictive performance of this new technique was variable, and in many cases molecular classifications were not subjected to appropriate validation. Validation in independent datasets has been rare. Furthermore, without full adjustment for previously known predictors of cancer outcomes, appraisal of the contribution of DNA microarray data towards individualising cancer management is difficult. ... incomplete cross-validation can lead to inflated estimates of accuracy. ... Reporting of only the best results spuriously inflates accuracy. ... Phase III studies have been rare in prognostic research in general. ... Complete, uncensored reporting, publicly available data, and standardisation within and between institutions are essential"}

  abstract = {A coefficient of explained randomness, analogous to explained variation but for non-linear models, was presented by Kent. The construct hinges upon the notion of KullbackâLeibler information gain. Kent and O'Quigley developed these ideas, obtaining simple, multiple and partial coefficients for the situation of proportional hazards regression. Their approach was based upon the idea of transforming a general proportional hazards model to a specific one of Weibull form. Xu and O'Quigley developed a more direct approach, more in harmony with the semi-parametric nature of the proportional hazards model thereby simplifying inference and allowing, for instance, the use of time dependent covariates. A potential drawback to the coefficient of Xu and O'Quigley is its interpretation as explained randomness in the covariate given time. An investigator might feel that the interpretation of the Kent and O'Quigley coefficient, as a proportion of explained randomness of time given the covariate, is preferable. One purpose of this note is to indicate that, under an independent censoring assumption, the two population coefficients coincide. Thus the simpler inferential setting for Xu and O'Quigley can also be applied to the coefficient of Kent and O'Quigley. Our second purpose is to point out that a sample-based coefficient in common use in the SAS statistical package can be interpreted as an estimate of explained randomness when there is no censoring. When there is censoring the SAS coefficient would not seem satisfactory in that its population counterpart depends on an independent censoring mechanism. However there is a quick fix and we argue in favour of its use.},

The central idea is to model the data from a single person with an OrnsteinâUhlenbeck diffusion process. We extend it hierarchically by allowing the parameters of the diffusion process to vary randomly over different persons. With this approach, both intra and interindividual differences are analyzed simultaneously. Furthermore, the individual difference parameters can be regressed on covariates, thereby providing an explanation of between-person differences. Unstructured and unbalanced data pose no problem for the model to be applied. We demonstrate the method on data from an experience sampling study to investigate changes in the core affect. It can be concluded that different factors from the five factor model of personality are related to features of the trajectories in the core affect space, such as the cross-correlation and variability of the changes.},

Two methods are scrutinized, namely the widely used linear mixed model (LMM) and the relatively unexplored OrnsteinâUhlenbeck (OU) process based state-space model. On the one hand, we show that given certain conditions they result in equivalent outcomes. On the other hand, we consider it important to emphasize that their perspectives are different and that one framework might better address certain types of research questions than the other. We show that, compared to a LMM, an OU process based approach can cope with modelling inter-individual differences in aspects that are more substantively interesting. However, the estimation of the LMM is faster and the model is more straightforward to implement. The models are illustrated through an experience sampling study.},

  abstract = {The accelerated failure time (AFT) model has been suggested as an alternative to the Cox proportional hazards model. However, a parametric AFT model requires the specification of an appropriate distribution for the event time, which is often difficult to identify in real-life studies and may limit applications. A semiparametric AFT model was developed by KomÃ¡rek et al based on smoothed error distribution that does not require such specification. In this article, we develop a spline-based AFT model that also does not require specification of the parametric family of event time distribution. The baseline hazard function is modeled by regression B-splines, allowing for the estimation of a variety of smooth and flexible shapes. In comprehensive simulations, we validate the performance of our approach and compare with the results from parametric AFT models and the approach of KomÃ¡rek. Both the proposed spline-based AFT model and the approach of KomÃ¡rek provided unbiased estimates of covariate effects and survival curves for a variety of scenarios in which the event time followed different distributions, including both simple and complex cases. Spline-based estimates of the baseline hazard showed also a satisfactory numerical stability. As expected, the baseline hazard and survival probabilities estimated by the misspecified parametric AFT models deviated from the truth. We illustrated the application of the proposed model in a study of colon cancer.},

Approximate standard errors for the estimated correlation coefficient are developed and a simulation study is used to compare the new methodology with existing methodology.

We represent interaction effect terms of the model through a set of treatment-specific flexible link functions on a linear combination of the covariates (a single index), subject to the constraint that the expected value given the covariates equals zero, while leaving the main effects of the covariates unspecified. We show that the proposed semiparametric estimator is consistent for the interaction term of the model, and that the efficiency of the estimator can be improved with an augmentation procedure. The proposed single-index regression provides a flexible and interpretable modeling approach to optimizing individualized treatment rules based on patients' data measured at baseline, as illustrated by simulation examples and an application to data from a depression clinical trial.

  abstract = {The wide availability of computers enables us to accumulate a huge amount of data, thus effective tools to extract information from the huge volume of data have become critical. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a useful and traditional tool for dimensionality reduction of massive high-dimensional datasets. Recently, sparse principal component (PC) loading estimation based on L1-type regularization has drawn a large amount of attention. Although sparse PCA makes interpretation easily and performs dimension reduction without disturbance from noisy features, the existing studies on sparse PCA were based on an arbitrary number of PCs without any statistical justification. We propose a novel method, called as automatic sparse PCA, which can perform PC selection and sparse PC loading estimation, simultaneously. For PC selection, we first develop sparse singular value decomposition (sparse SVD), then incorporate sparsity into PC loading estimation. The proposed method enables us to perform dimension reduction and PC loading estimation, simultaneously. Furthermore, we can perform PCA without disturbance from noisy features. It can be seen through Monte Carlo experiments that the proposed automatic sparse PCA outperforms sparse structure identification and reconstructing data based on low-dimensional projection. The proposed method is also applied to a number of real datasets and it can be also seen that our method achieves effectiveness for estimation accuracy and interpreting PCA results.},

Traditionally, data consist in sequences of observed states for a given number of individuals over the whole observation period. In such a case, the estimation of transition probabilities is straightforwardly made by counting one-step moves from a given state to another. In many real-life problems, however, the inference is much more difficult as state sequences are not fully observed, namely the state of each individual is known only for some given values of the time variable. A review of the problem is given, focusing on Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithms to perform Bayesian inference and evaluate posterior distributions of the transition probabilities in this missing-data framework. Leaning on the dependence between the rows of the transition matrix, an adaptive MCMC mechanism accelerating the classical Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is then proposed and empirically studied.},

The association of antenatal exposures with NAS was evaluated by using multivariable logistic regression, controlling for maternal and infant characteristics. Of 112,029 pregnant women, 31,354 (28\%) filled â¥ 1 opioid prescription. Women prescribed opioid pain relievers were more likely than those not prescribed opioids (P {$<$} .001) to have depression (5.3\% vs 2.7\%), anxiety disorder (4.3\% vs 1.6\%) and to smoke tobacco (41.8\% vs 25.8\%). Infants with NAS and opioid-exposed infants were more likely than unexposed infants to be born at a low birth weight (21.2\% vs 11.8\% vs 9.9\%; P {$<$} .001). In a multivariable model, higher cumulative opioid exposure for short-acting preparations (P {$<$} .001), opioid type (P {$<$} .001), number of daily cigarettes smoked (P {$<$} .001), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use (odds ratio: 2.08 [95\% confidence interval: 1.67-2.60]) were associated with greater risk of developing NAS. Prescription opioid use in pregnancy is common and strongly associated with neonatal complications. Antenatal cumulative prescription opioid exposure, opioid type, tobacco use, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use increase the risk of NAS.

  abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is one of the main causes of morbidity, hospitalization, and death in the western world, and the economic burden associated with HF management is relevant and expected to increase in the future. We consider hospitalization data for HF in the most populated Italian Region, Lombardia. Data were extracted from the administrative data warehouse of the regional healthcare system. The main clinical outcome of interest is time to death and research focus is on investigating how recurrent hospitalizations affect the time to event. The main contribution of the article is to develop a joint model for gap times between consecutive rehospitalizations and survival time. The probability models for the gap times and for the survival outcome share a common patient specific frailty term. Using a flexible Dirichlet process model for \%Bayesian nonparametric prior as the random-effects distribution accounts for patient heterogeneity in recurrent event trajectories. Moreover, the joint model allows for dependent censoring of gap times by death or administrative reasons and for the correlations between different gap times for the same individual. It is straightforward to include covariates in the survival and/or recurrence process through the specification of appropriate regression terms. The main advantages of the proposed methodology are wide applicability, ease of interpretation, and efficient computations. Posterior inference is implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.},

The industry standards for interpretable hypothesis tests in survival analysis, RMST and logrank tests (LRTs), can suffer from low power in cases where the proportional hazards assumption fails. In particular, when late differences occur between survival curves, our proposed estimate and class of tests, window mean survival time (WMST), outperforms both RMST and LRT without sacrificing interpretability, unlike weighted rank tests (WRTs). WMST has the added advantage of maintaining high power when the proportional hazards assumption is met, while WRTs do not. With testing methods often being chosen in advance of data collection, WMST can ensure adequate power without distributional assumptions and is robust to the choice of its restriction parameters. Functions for performing WMST analysis are provided in the survWM2 package in R.},

  abstract = {This review presents empirical researcherswith recent advancesin causal inference, and stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis ofmultivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assump-tions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, andthe methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation basedon the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described  in Pearl(2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interven-tions, (also called âcausal effectsâ or âpolicy evaluationâ) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of âregret,â âattri-butionâ or âcauses of effectsâ) and (3) queries about direct and indirecteffects (also known as âmediationâ). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

This paper treats a particular problem of generalizability, called âtransportability,â defined as a license to transfer causal effects learned in experimental studies to a new population, in which only observational studies can be conducted. We introduce a formal representation called âselection diagramsâ for expressing knowledge about differences and commonalities between populations of interest and, using this representation, we reduce questions of transportability to symbolic derivations in the do-calculus. This reduction yields graph-based procedures for deciding, prior to observing any data, whether causal effects in the target population can be inferred from experimental findings in the study population. When the answer is affirmative, the procedures identify what experimental and observational findings need be obtained from the two populations, and how they can be combined to ensure bias-free transport.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that in the setting of linear discriminant analysis, under the assumptions of multivariate normality, all three measures can be presented as functions of the squared Mahalanobis distance. This relationship affords an interpretation of the magnitude of these measures in the familiar language of effect size for uncorrelated variables. Furthermore, it allows us to conclude that net reclassification improvement can be viewed as a universal measure of effect size.

  abstract = {Cardiovascular risk prediction functions offer an important diagnostic tool for clinicians and patients themselves. They are usually constructed with the use of parametric or semi-parametric survival regression models. It is essential to be able to evaluate the performance of these models, preferably with summaries that offer natural and intuitive interpretations. The concept of discrimination, popular in the logistic regression context, has been extended to survival analysis. However, the extension is not unique. In this paper, we define discrimination in survival analysis as the model's ability to separate those with longer event-free survival from those with shorter event-free survival within some time horizon of interest. This definition remains consistent with that used in logistic regression, in the sense that it assesses how well the model-based predictions match the observed data. Practical and conceptual examples and numerical simulations are employed to examine four C statistics proposed in the literature to evaluate the performance of survival models. We observe that they differ in the numerical values and aspects of discrimination that they capture. We conclude that the index proposed by Harrell is the most appropriate to capture discrimination described by the above definition. We suggest researchers report which C statistic they are using, provide a rationale for their selection, and be aware that comparing different indices across studies may not be meaningful.},

  abstract = {Data mining and machine learning techniques such as classification and regression trees (CART) represent a promising alternative to conventional logistic regression for propensity score estimation. Whereas incomplete data preclude the fitting of a logistic regression on all subjects, CART is appealing in part because some implementations allow for incomplete records to be incorporated in the tree fitting and provide propensity score estimates for all subjects. Based on theoretical considerations, we argue that the automatic handling of missing data by CART may however not be appropriate. Using a series of simulation experiments, we examined the performance of different approaches to handling missing covariate data; (i) applying the CART algorithm directly to the (partially) incomplete data, (ii) complete case analysis, and (iii) multiple imputation. Performance was assessed in terms of bias in estimating exposure-outcome effects among the exposed, standard error, mean squared error and coverage. Applying the CART algorithm directly to incomplete data resulted in bias, even in scenarios where data were missing completely at random. Overall, multiple imputation followed by CART resulted in the best performance. Our study showed that automatic handling of missing data in CART can cause serious bias and does not outperform multiple imputation as a means to account for missing data.},

  abstract = {Authors have proposed new methodology in recent years for evaluating the improvement in prediction performance gained by adding a new predictor, Y, to a risk model containing a set of baseline predictors, X, for a binary outcome D. We prove theoretically that null hypotheses concerning no improvement in performance are equivalent to the simple null hypothesis that Y is not a risk factor when controlling for X, H0 : P(D\,=\,1\,|\,X,Y )\,=\,P(D\,=\,1\,|\,X). Therefore, testing for improvement in prediction performance is redundant if Y has already been shown to be a risk factor. We also investigate properties of tests through simulation studies, focusing on the change in the area under the ROC curve (AUC). An unexpected finding is that standard testing procedures that do not adjust for variability in estimated regression coefficients are extremely conservative. This may explain why the AUC is widely considered insensitive to improvements in prediction performance and suggests that the problem of insensitivity has to do with use of invalid procedures for inference rather than with the measure itself. To avoid redundant testing and use of potentially problematic methods for inference, we recommend that hypothesis testing for no improvement be limited to evaluation of Y as a risk factor, for which methods are well developed and widely available. Analyses of measures of prediction performance should focus on estimation rather than on testing for no improvement in performance.},

Data were used from a trial on the effects of Rosuvastatin on rate of change in carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). The reference treatment effect was derived from a complete data set. Scenarios and proportions of missing values in CIMT measurements were applied and LME analyses were used before and after MI. The added value of MI, in terms of bias and precision, was assessed using the mean-squared error (MSE) of the treatment effects and coverage of the 95\% confidence interval. The reference treatment effect was -0.0177mm/y. The MSEs for LME analysis without and with MI were similar in scenarios with up to 40\% missing values. Coverage was large in all scenarios and was similar for LME with and without MI. Our study empirically shows that MI of missing end point data before LME analyses does not increase precision in the estimated rate of change in the end point. Hence, MI had no added value in this setting and standard LME modeling remains the method of choice.},

  abstract = {Composite endpoints are commonly used to define primary outcomes in randomized controlled trials. A participant may be classified as meeting the endpoint if they experience an event in one or several components (eg, a favorable outcome based on a composite of being alive and attaining negative culture results in trials assessing tuberculosis treatments). Partially observed components that are not missing simultaneously complicate the analysis of the composite endpoint. An intuitive strategy frequently used in practice for handling missing values in the components is to derive the values of the composite endpoint from observed components when possible, and exclude from analysis participants whose composite endpoint cannot be derived. Alternatively, complete record analysis (CRA) (excluding participants with any missing components) or multiple imputation (MI) can be used. We compare a set of methods for analyzing a composite endpoint with partially observed components mathematically and by simulation, and apply these methods in a reanalysis of a published trial (TOPPS). We show that the derived composite endpoint can be missing not at random even when the components are missing completely at random. Consequently, the treatment effect estimated from the derived endpoint is biased while CRA results without the derived endpoint are valid. Missing at random mechanisms require MI of the components. We conclude that, although superficially attractive, deriving the composite endpoint from observed components should generally be avoided. Despite the potential risk of imputation model mis-specification, MI of missing components is the preferred approach in this study setting.},

  abstract = {Sample size calculations for two-arm clinical trials with a time-to-event endpoint have traditionally used the assumption of proportional hazards (PH) or the assumption of exponentially distributed survival times. Available software provides methods for sample size calculation using a nonparametric logrank test, Schoenfeld's formula for Cox PH model, or parametric calculations specific to the exponential distribution. In cases where the PH assumption is not valid, the first-choice method is to compute sample size assuming a piecewise linear survival curve (Lakatos approach) for both the control and treatment arms with judiciously chosen cut-points. Recent advances in literature have used the assumption of Weibull distributed times for single-arm trials, and, newer methods have emerged that allow sample size calculations for two-arm trials using the assumption of proportional time (PT) while considering non-PH. These methods, however, always assume an instantaneous effect of treatment relative to control requiring that the effect size be defined by a single number whose magnitude is preserved throughout the trial duration. Here, we consider the scenarios where the hypothesized benefit of treatment relative to control may not be constant giving rise to the notion of Relative Time (RT). By assuming that survival times for control and treatment arm come from two different Weibull distributions with different location and shape parameters, we develop the methodology for sample size calculation for specific cases of both non-PH and non-PT.

  abstract = {Stability is a major requirement to draw reliable conclusions when interpreting results from supervised statistical learning. In this article, we present a general framework for assessing and comparing the stability of results, which can be used in real-world statistical learning applications as well as in simulation and benchmark studies. We use the framework to show that stability is a property of both the algorithm and the data-generating process. In particular, we demonstrate that unstable algorithms (such as recursive partitioning) can produce stable results when the functional form of the relationship between the predictors and the response matches the algorithm. Typical uses of the framework in practical data analysis would be to compare the stability of results generated by different candidate algorithms for a dataset at hand or to assess the stability of algorithms in a benchmark study. Code to perform the stability analyses is provided in the form of an R package. Supplementary material for this article is available online.},

The final version of the addendum to ICH E9 (R1) (2) was issued in November 2019. This virtual edition of Pharmaceutical Statistics takes a closer look at some of the progress that has been made since 2018 when implementing the estimand framework within clinical research. The articles discussed in this virtual issue are not new, but a compilation from previous issues. This specific article will act as a refresher for those not familiar with the topic and discuss the ABCs of estimands and their proposed deployment for improving the quality of clinical research. An overview of the more recent Pharmaceutical Statistics articles on estimands will be provided, signifying areas where progress have been made. The articles should be considered as contributions to the ongoing discussions rather than the final word. Finally, a personal perspective on the estimand success story and remaining challenges with proposed solutions will be discussed.},

Methods exist for inference concerning the sensitivity of one or more tests for fixed levels of specificity, taking into account the variability in the sensitivity due to variability in the test values for normal subjects. However, parametric methods do not adequately account for error, particularly when the data are non-normally distributed, and non-parametric methods have low power. We implement bootstrap methods for confidence limits for the sensitivity of a test for a fixed specificity and demonstrate that under certain circumstances the bootstrap method gives more accurate confidence intervals than do other methods, while it performs at least as well as other methods in many standard situations.

You are confronted with a question: Is the percentage of African countries in the United Nations greater or less than 65? Not a matter you have thought much about, but nonetheless, you are fairly sure that the percentage is less than 65. What, you are asked, is the {$<$}i{$>$}exact{$<$}/i{$>$} percentage of African countries in the United Nations? After some thought, you respond with an estimate of 45 percent. A research records your response, thanks you for your time, and off you go. Now you are another person, a person who has not yet answered questions about the United Nations, a person for whom the wheel of fortune will land on 10 rather than 65. After the wheel has stopped moving, the researcher asks: Is the percentage of African countries in the United Nations great or less than 10? More you say -- certainly it must be more. What is the {$<$}i{$>$}exact{$<$}/i{$>$} percentage of African countries in the United Nations? After some thought, you respond with an estimate of 25 percent. In fact, just a procedure, yielding identical results, was conducted by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1974). Subjects who were randomly assigned to an experimental condition in which the needle landed on 65 subsequently gave a median estimate of 45 percent, and subjects for whom the needle landed on 10 gave a median estimate of 25 percent. Tversky and Kahneman explained this phenomenon in terms of 'anchoring and adjustment' -- that is, the insufficient adjustment up or down from an original starting value, or 'anchor'. ... Surprisingly, the effects of anchoring do not disappear with monetary incentives for accuracy (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974; Wright and Anderson, 1989) or with outrageously extreme anchors (Quattrone et al., 1984). In one experiment, Quattrone and his associates (1984) solicited exact numerical estimates after first asking whether the number of Beatles records that had made the top 10 fell above or below 100,025 albums, whether the average price of a college textbook was more or less than 7128.53, or whether the average temperature in San Francisco was greater or less than 558. Quattrone's research team found that absurdly high anchor values worked just as well as more plausible anchor values. From this result, they concluded that anchoring is a robust phenomenon in which the size of the effect grows with the discrepancy between the anchor and the 'preanchor estimate' ... until the effect reaches an asymptotic level. If true, these findings suggest that negotiators, advertisers, politicians, and other persuasion specialists will generally be most succesful by staking out extreme initial positions."}

  abstract = {The conventional reporting of composite endpoints in clinical trials has an inherent limitation in that it emphasizes each patient's first event, which is often the outcome of lesser clinical importance. To overcome this problem, we introduce the concept of the win ratio for reporting composite endpoints. Patients in the new treatment and control groups are formed into matched pairs based on their risk profiles. Consider a primary composite endpoint, e.g. cardiovascular (CV) death and heart failure hospitalization (HF hosp) in heart failure trials. For each matched pair, the new treatment patient is labelled a 'winner' or a 'loser' depending on who had a CV death first. If that is not known, only then they are labelled a 'winner' or 'loser' depending on who had a HF hosp first. Otherwise they are considered tied. The win ratio is the total number of winners divided by the total numbers of losers. A 95\% confidence interval and P-value for the win ratio are readily obtained. If formation of matched pairs is impractical then an alternative win ratio can be obtained by comparing all possible unmatched pairs. This method is illustrated by re-analyses of the EMPHASIS-HF, PARTNER B, and CHARM trials. The win ratio is a new method for reporting composite endpoints, which is easy to use and gives appropriate priority to the more clinically important event, e.g. mortality. We encourage its use in future trial reports.},

  abstract = {Basket trials have become a virulent topic in medical and statistical research during the last decade. The core idea of them is to treat patients, who express the same genetic predispositionâeither personally or their diseaseâwith the same treatment irrespective of the location of the disease. The location of the disease defines each basket and the pathway of the treatment uses the common genetic predisposition among the baskets. This opens the opportunity to share information among baskets, which can consequently increase the information of the basket-wise response with respect to the investigated treatment. This further allows dynamic decisions regarding futility and efficacy of individual baskets during the ongoing trial. Several statistical designs have been proposed on how a basket trial can be conducted and this has left an unclear situation with many options. The different designs propose different mathematical and statistical techniques, different decision rules, and also different trial purposes. This paper presents a broad overview of existing designs, categorizes them, and elaborates their similarities and differences. A uniform and consistent notation facilitates the first contact, introduction, and understanding of the statistical methodologies and techniques used in basket trials. Finally, this paper presents a modular approach for the construction of basket trials in applied medical science and forms a base for further research of basket trial designs and their techniques.},

  abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of investigational interventions. If every patient in an RCT were to adhere to the randomized treatment, one could simply analyze the complete data to infer the treatment effect. However, intercurrent events (ICEs) including the use of concomitant medication for unsatisfactory efficacy, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, or lack of efficacy may lead to interventions that deviate from the original treatment assignment. Therefore, defining the appropriate estimand (the appropriate parameter to be estimated) based on the primary objective of the study is critical prior to determining the statistical analysis method and analyzing the data. The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E9 (R1), adopted on November 20, 2019, provided five strategies to define the estimand: treatment policy, hypothetical, composite variable, while on treatment, and principal stratum. In this article, we propose an estimand using a mix of strategies in handling ICEs. This estimand is an average of the ânullâ treatment difference for those with ICEs potentially related to safety and the treatment difference for the other patients if they would complete the assigned treatments. Two examples from clinical trials evaluating antidiabetes treatments are provided to illustrate the estimation of this proposed estimand and to compare it with the estimates for estimands using hypothetical and treatment policy strategies in handling ICEs.},

  abstract = {Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are economic tools that elicit the stated preferences of respondents. Because of their increasing importance in informing the design of health products and services, it is critical to understand the extent to which DCEs give reliable predictions outside of the experimental context. We systematically reviewed the literature of published DCE studies comparing predictions to choices made in reality; we extracted individual-level data to estimate a bivariate mixed-effects model of pooled sensitivity and specificity. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, and six of these gave sufficient data for inclusion in a meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates were 88\% (95\% CI 81, 92\%) and 34\% (95\% CI 23, 46\%), respectively, and the area under the SROC curve (AUC) was 0.60 (95\% CI 0.55, 0.64). Results indicate that DCEs can produce reasonable predictions of health-related behaviors. There is a great need for future research on the external validity of DCEs, particularly empirical studies assessing predicted and revealed preferences of a representative sample of participants.},

  abstract = {Our purpose was to quantify missing baseline laboratory results, assess predictors of missingness, and examine performance of missing data methods. Using the Mini-Sentinel Distributed Database from three sites, we selected three exposure-outcome scenarios with laboratory results as baseline confounders. We compared hazard ratios (HRs) or risk differences (RDs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) from models that omitted laboratory results, included only available results (complete cases), and included results after applying missing data methods (multiple imputation [MI] regression, MI predictive mean matching [PMM] indicator). Scenario 1 considered glucose among second-generation antipsychotic users and diabetes. Across sites, glucose was available for 27.7-58.9\%. Results differed between complete case and missing data models (e.g., olanzapine: HR 0.92 [CI 0.73, 1.12] vs 1.02 [0.90, 1.16]). Across-site models employing different MI approaches provided similar HR and CI; site-specific models provided differing estimates. Scenario 2 evaluated creatinine among individuals starting high versus low dose lisinopril and hyperkalemia. Creatinine availability: 44.5-79.0\%. Results differed between complete case and missing data models (e.g., HR 0.84 [CI 0.77, 0.92] vs. 0.88 [0.83, 0.94]). HR and CI were identical across MI methods. Scenario 3 examined international normalized ratio (INR) among warfarin users starting interacting versus noninteracting antimicrobials and bleeding. INR availability: 20.0-92.9\%. Results differed between ignoring INR versus including INR using missing data methods (e.g., RD 0.05 [CI -0.03, 0.13] vs 0.09 [0.00, 0.18]). Indicator and PMM methods gave similar estimates. Multi-site studies must consider site variability in missing data. Different missing data methods performed similarly. Copyright  2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

  abstract = {Purpose: Deviations from proportional hazards (DPH), which may be more prevalent in the era of precision medicine and immunotherapy, can lead to under-powered trials or misleading conclusions. We used a meta-analytic approach to estimate DPH across cancer trials, investigate associated factors, and evaluate data-analysis approaches for future trials. Experimental Design: We searched PubMed for phase III trials in breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer published in a pre-selected list of journals between 2014-2016 and extracted individual patient-level data (IPLD) from Kaplan-Meier curves. We re-analyzed IPLD to identify DPH. Potential efficiency gains, when DPHs were present, of alternative statistical methods relative to standard log-rank based analysis were expressed as sample-size requirements for a fixed power level. Results: From 152 trials, we obtained IPLD on 129,401 patients. Among 304 Kaplan-Meier figures, 75 (24.7\%) exhibited evidence of DPH, including 8 of 14 (57\%) KM pairs from immunotherapy trials. Trial type (immunotherapy, odds ratio (OR) 4.29, 95\%CI 1.11-16.6), metastatic patient population (OR 3.18, 95\%CI 1.26-8.05), and non-OS endpoints (OR 3.23, 95\%CI 1.79-5.88) were associated with DPH. In immunotherapy trials, alternative statistical approaches allowed for more efficient clinical trials with fewer patients (up to 74\% reduction) relative to log-rank testing. Conclusions: DPH was found in a notable proportion of time-to-event outcomes in published clinical trials in oncology and was more common for immunotherapy trials and non-OS endpoints. Alternative statistical methods, without proportional hazards assumptions, should be considered in the design and analysis of clinical trials when the likelihood of DPH is high.

  abstract = {The K-means algorithm is one of the most popular clustering algorithms in current use as it is relatively fast yet simple to understand and deploy in practice. Nevertheless, its use entails certain restrictive assumptions about the data, the negative consequences of which are not always immediately apparent, as we demonstrate. While more flexible algorithms have been developed, their widespread use has been hindered by their computational and technical complexity. Motivated by these considerations, we present a flexible alternative to K-means that relaxes most of the assumptions, whilst remaining almost as fast and simple. This novel algorithm which we call MAP-DP (maximum a-posteriori Dirichlet process mixtures), is statistically rigorous as it is based on nonparametric Bayesian Dirichlet process mixture modeling. This approach allows us to overcome most of the limitations imposed by K-means. The number of clusters K is estimated from the data instead of being fixed a-priori as in K-means. In addition, while K-means is restricted to continuous data, the MAP-DP framework can be applied to many kinds of data, for example, binary, count or ordinal data. Also, it can efficiently separate outliers from the data. This additional flexibility does not incur a significant computational overhead compared to K-means with MAP-DP convergence typically achieved in the order of seconds for many practical problems. Finally, in contrast to K-means, since the algorithm is based on an underlying statistical model, the MAP-DP framework can deal with missing data and enables model testing such as cross validation in a principled way. We demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of this algorithm on the health informatics problem of clinical sub-typing in a cluster of diseases known as parkinsonism.},

  abstract = {Biomarkers play a key role in the monitoring of disease progression. The time taken for an individual to reach a biomarker exceeding or lower than a meaningful threshold is often of interest. Due to the inherent variability of biomarkers, persistence criteria are sometimes included in the definitions of progression, such that only two consecutive measurements above or below the relevant threshold signal that âtrueâ progression has occurred. In previous work, a novel approach was developed, which allowed estimation of the time to threshold using the parameters from a linear mixed model where the residual variance was assumed to be pure measurement error. In this paper, we extend this methodology so that serial correlation can be accommodated. Assuming that the Markov property holds and applying the chain rule of probabilities, we found that the probability of progression at each timepoint can be expressed simply as the product of conditional probabilities. The methodology is applied to a cohort of HIV positive individuals, where the time to reach a CD4 count threshold is estimated. The second application we present is based on a study on abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the time taken for an individual to reach a diameter exceeding 55 mm is studied. We observed that erroneously ignoring the residual correlation when it is strong may result in substantial overestimation of the time to threshold. The estimated probability of the biomarker reaching a threshold of interest, expected time to threshold, and confidence intervals are presented for selected patients in both applications.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number of studies using a cluster-randomized design has grown dramatically. In addition, the cluster-randomized crossover design has been touted as a methodological advance that can increase efficiency of cluster-randomized studies in certain situations. While the cluster-randomized crossover trial has become a popular tool, standards of design, analysis, reporting and implementation have not been established for this emergent design. We address one particular aspect of cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover trial design: estimating statistical power. We present a general framework for estimating power via simulation in cluster-randomized studies with or without one or more crossover periods. We have implemented this framework in the clusterPower software package for R, freely available online from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Our simulation framework is easy to implement and users may customize the methods used for data analysis. We give four examples of using the software in practice. The clusterPower package could play an important role in the design of future cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover studies. This work is the first to establish a universal method for calculating power for both cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized clinical trials. More research is needed to develop standardized and recommended methodology for cluster-randomized crossover studies.},

BO is a method to optimize expensive black-box functions, by using a regression as a surrogate to guide the search. In clinical trials, planning test procedures and sample sizes is a crucial task. A common goal is to maximize the test power, given a set of treatments, corresponding effect sizes, and a total number of samples. From a wide range of possible designs, we aim to select the best one in a short time to allow quick decisions. The standard approach to simulate the power for each single design can become too time consuming. When the number of possible designs becomes very large, either large computational resources are required or an exhaustive exploration of all possible designs takes too long. Here, we propose to use BO to quickly find a clinical trial design with high power from a large number of candidate designs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by optimizing the power of adaptive seamless designs for different sets of treatment effect sizes. Comparing BO with an exhaustive evaluation of all candidate designs shows that BO finds competitive designs in a fraction of the time.},

Results of our simulation studies show that the omission, or the inclusion, of time-invariant covariates is not important in models with exogenous baseline responses, while it has an essential effect on fitting models with the endogenous baseline responses. It is also emphasized that the effect becomes minor when the endogeneity issue is handled. The practical consequences are illustrated in the analysis of a real data set taken from medical sciences.},

  abstract = {In the medical literature, hundreds of prediction models are being developed to predict health outcomes in individuals. For continuous outcomes, typically a linear regression model is developed to predict an individual's outcome value conditional on values of multiple predictors (covariates). To improve model development and reduce the potential for overfitting, a suitable sample size is required in terms of the number of subjects (n) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) for potential inclusion. We propose that the minimum value of n should meet the following four key criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of â¥0.9; (ii) small absolute difference of â¤ 0.05 in the apparent and adjusted R2; (iii) precise estimation (a margin of error â¤ 10\% of the true value) of the model's residual standard deviation; and similarly, (iv) precise estimation of the mean predicted outcome value (model intercept). The criteria require prespecification of the user's chosen p and the model's anticipated R2 as informed by previous studies. The value of n that meets all four criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. In an applied example, a new model to predict lung function in African-American women using 25 predictor parameters requires at least 918 subjects to meet all criteria, corresponding to at least 36.7 subjects per predictor parameter. Even larger sample sizes may be needed to additionally ensure precise estimates of key predictor effects, especially when important categorical predictors have low prevalence in certain categories.},

  abstract = {In the medical literature, hundreds of prediction models are being developed to predict health outcomes in individuals. For continuous outcomes, typically a linear regression model is developed to predict an individual's outcome value conditional on values of multiple predictors (covariates). To improve model development and reduce the potential for overfitting, a suitable sample size is required in terms of the number of subjects (n) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) for potential inclusion. We propose that the minimum value of n should meet the following four key criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of â¥0.9; (ii) small absolute difference of â¤ 0.05 in the apparent and adjusted R2 ; (iii) precise estimation (a margin of error â¤ 10\% of the true value) of the model's residual standard deviation; and similarly, (iv) precise estimation of the mean predicted outcome value (model intercept). The criteria require prespecification of the user's chosen p and the model's anticipated R2 as informed by previous studies. The value of n that meets all four criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. In an applied example, a new model to predict lung function in African-American women using 25 predictor parameters requires at least 918 subjects to meet all criteria, corresponding to at least 36.7 subjects per predictor parameter. Even larger sample sizes may be needed to additionally ensure precise estimates of key predictor effects, especially when important categorical predictors have low prevalence in certain categories.},

  abstract = {In prediction model research, external validation is needed to examine an existing model's performance using data independent to that for model development. Current external validation studies often suffer from small sample sizes and consequently imprecise predictive performance estimates. To address this, we propose how to determine the minimum sample size needed for a new external validation study of a prediction model for a binary outcome. Our calculations aim to precisely estimate calibration (Observed/Expected and calibration slope), discrimination (C-statistic), and clinical utility (net benefit). For each measure, we propose closed-form and iterative solutions for calculating the minimum sample size required. These require specifying: (i) target SEs (confidence interval widths) for each estimate of interest, (ii) the anticipated outcome event proportion in the validation population, (iii) the prediction model's anticipated (mis)calibration and variance of linear predictor values in the validation population, and (iv) potential risk thresholds for clinical decision-making. The calculations can also be used to inform whether the sample size of an existing (already collected) dataset is adequate for external validation. We illustrate our proposal for external validation of a prediction model for mechanical heart valve failure with an expected outcome event proportion of 0.018. Calculations suggest at least 9835 participants (177 events) are required to precisely estimate the calibration and discrimination measures, with this number driven by the calibration slope criterion, which we anticipate will often be the case. Also, 6443 participants (116 events) are required to precisely estimate net benefit at a risk threshold of 8\%. Software code is provided.},

The minimum sample size criteria aim to ensure precise estimation of key measures of a model's predictive performance, including measures of calibration, discrimination, and net benefit. Here, we extend the sample size guidance to prediction models with a time-to-event (survival) outcome, to cover external validation in datasets containing censoring. A simulation-based framework is proposed, which calculates the sample size required to target a particular confidence interval width for the calibration slope measuring the agreement between predicted risks (from the model) and observed risks (derived using pseudo-observations to account for censoring) on the log cumulative hazard scale. Precise estimation of calibration curves, discrimination, and net-benefit can also be checked in this framework. The process requires assumptions about the validation population in terms of the (i) distribution of the model's linear predictor and (ii) event and censoring distributions. Existing information can inform this; in particular, the linear predictor distribution can be approximated using the C-index or Royston's D statistic from the model development article, together with the overall event risk. We demonstrate how the approach can be used to calculate the sample size required to validate a prediction model for recurrent venous thromboembolism. Ideally the sample size should ensure precise calibration across the entire range of predicted risks, but must at least ensure adequate precision in regions important for clinical decision-making.

As for any sample size calculation, the approach requires the user to specify anticipated values for key parameters. In particular, for a prediction model with a binary outcome, the outcome proportion and a conservative estimate for the overall fit of the developed model as measured by the Cox-Snell R2 (proportion of variance explained) must be specified. This proposal raises the question of how to identify a plausible value for R2 in advance of model development. Our articles suggest researchers should identify R2 from closely related models already published in their field. In this letter, we present details on how to derive R2 using the reported C statistic (AUROC) for such existing prediction models with a binary outcome. The C statistic is commonly reported, and so our approach allows researchers to obtain R2 for subsequent sample size calculations for new models.

This method, named eigenvectors from eigenvalues sparse principal component analysis (EESPCA), is based on the formula for computing squared eigenvector loadings of a Hermitian matrix from the eigenvalues of the full matrix and associated sub-matrices. We explore two versions of the EESPCA method: a version that uses a fixed threshold for inducing sparsity and a version that selects the threshold via cross-validation. Relative to the state-of-the-art sparse PCA methods of Witten et al., Yuan and Zhang, and Tan et al., the fixed threshold EESPCA technique offers an order-of-magnitude improvement in computational speed, does not require estimation of tuning parameters via cross-validation, and can more accurately identify true zero principal component loadings across a range of data matrix sizes and covariance structures. Importantly, the EESPCA method achieves these benefits while maintaining out-of-sample reconstruction error and PC estimation error close to the lowest error generated by all evaluated approaches. EESPCA is a practical and effective technique for sparse PCA with particular relevance to computationally demanding statistical problems such as the analysis of high-dimensional datasets or application of statistical techniques like resampling that involve the repeated calculation of sparse PCs.

Rational choice models require potential outcomes (e.g., benefits/costs) to be weighted by their probability of occurrence. Indeed, the subjective likelihood of being apprehended is the central construct in criminological deterrence theoryâthe so-called certainty principle. Yet, extant literature has measured the construct inconsistently and with little attention to potential consequences. Using a series of randomized experiments conducted with nationwide samples of American adults (aged 18 and over), this study examines the degree of correspondence between verbal and numeric measures of apprehension risk, assesses the durability of numeric estimates specifically, and attempts to elicit how respondents naturally think about apprehension risk. The findings suggest that laypeople are somewhat inconsistent in their use of both verbal and numeric descriptors of probability, their numeric estimates of probability are unlikely to be precise or durable, and many seem to prefer thinking of risk in verbal terms (compared to numeric terms). Researchers should consider including both verbal and numeric measures of probability and explore alternative measurement strategies, including anchoring vignettes, which have been valuable in standardizing verbal responses in other disciplines.},

When designing a trial, it is crucial to determine the appropriate sample size for testing the statistical differences between treatment groups for the primary endpoint. As shown in this work, when using a composite binary endpoint to size a trial, one needs to specify the event rates and the effect sizes of the composite components as well as the correlation between them. In practice, the marginal parameters of the components can be obtained from previous studies or pilot trials; however, the correlation is often not previously reported and thus usually unknown. We first show that the sample size for composite binary endpoints is strongly dependent on the correlation and, second, that slight deviations in the prior information on the marginal parameters may result in underpowered trials for achieving the study objectives at a pre-specified significance level. We propose a general strategy for calculating the required sample size when the correlation is not specified and accounting for uncertainty in the marginal parameter values. We present the web platform CompARE to characterize composite endpoints and to calculate the sample size just as we propose in this paper. We evaluate the performance of the proposal with a simulation study and illustrate it by means of a real case study using CompARE.},

  abstract = {The design of a comparative clinical trial involves a method of allocating treatments to patients. Usually, this assignment is performed to achieve several objectives: to minimize selection and accidental bias, to achieve balanced treatment assignment in order to maximize the power of the comparison, and most importantly, to obtain the basis for a valid statistical inference. In this paper, we are concerned exclusively with the last point. In our investigation, we will assume that measurements can be decomposed in a patient-specific effect, a treatment effect, and a measurement error. If the patient can be considered to be randomly drawn from a population, the randomization method does not affect the analysis. In fact, under this so-called population model, randomization would be unnecessary to obtain a valid inference. However, when individuals cannot be considered randomly selected, the patient effects may become fixed but unknown constants. In this case, randomization is necessary to obtain valid statistical analyses, and it cannot be precluded that the randomization method has an impact on the results. This paper elaborates that the impact can be substantial even for a two-sample comparison when a standard t-test is used for data analysis. We provide some theoretical results as well as simulations.},

  note = {"The theoretical basis for advocating a routine adjustment for multiple comparisons is the `universal null hypothesis' that `chance' serves as the first-order explanation for observed phenomena. This hypothesis undermines the basic premises of empirical research, which holds that nature follows regular laws that may be studied through observations. A policy of not making adjustments for multiple comparisons is preferable because it will lead to fewer errors of interpretation when the data under evaluation are not random numbers but actual observations on nature. Furthermore, scientists should not be so reluctant to explore leads that may turn out to be wrong that they penalize themselves by missing possibly important findings."}

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) with its benchmark p-value{$<$}0.05 has long been a stalwart of scientific reporting and such statistically significant findings have been used to imply scientifically or clinically significant findings. Challenges to this approach have arisen over the past six decades, but they have largely been unheeded. There is a growing movement for using Bayesian statistical inference to quantify the probability that a scientific finding is credible. There have been differences of opinion between the frequentist (i.e. NHST) and Bayesian schools of inference, and warnings about the use or misuse of p-values have come from both schools of thought spanning many decades. Controversies in this arena have been heightened by the American Statistical Association statement on p-values and the further denouncement of the term âstatistical significanceâ by others. My experience has been that many scientists, including many statisticians, do not have a sound conceptual grasp of the fundamental differences in these approaches, thereby creating even greater confusion and acrimony. If we let A represent the observed data, and B represent the hypothesis of interest, then the fundamental distinction between these two approaches can be described as the frequentist approach using the conditional probability pr(A|B), i.e. the p-value, and the Bayesian approach using pr(B|A), the posterior probability. This article will further explain the fundamental differences in NHST and Bayesian approaches and demonstrate how they can co-exist harmoniously to guide clinical trial design and inference.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Prognostic models including early postoperative variables may provide optimal estimates of long-term outcomes and help direct postoperative care. PURPOSE: To develop and validate prognostic models for 12-month disability, back pain, leg pain, and satisfaction among patients undergoing microdiscectomy, laminectomy, and laminectomy with fusion for degenerative lumbar conditions. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective cohort study using the Quality Outcomes Database. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients receiving elective lumbar spine surgery due to degenerative spine conditions. OUTCOME MEASURES: Oswestry Disability Index, pain numerical rating scale, and NASS Patient Satisfaction Index. METHODS: Prognostic models were developed using proportional odds ordinal logistic regression using patient characteristics and baseline and 3-month patient-reported outcome scores. Models were fit for each outcome stratified by type of surgical procedure. Adjusted odds ratio and 95\% confidence intervals were reported for all predictors by procedure. Models were internally validated using bootstrap resampling. Discrimination was reported as the c-index and calibration was presented using the calibration slope. We compared the performance of models with and without 3-month patient-reported variables. This research was supported by the Foundation for Physical Therapy's Center of Excellence in Physical Therapy Health Services, and Health Policy Research and Training grant. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 5,840 patients receiving a microdiscectomy (n=2,085), laminectomy (n=1,837), or laminectomy with fusion (n=1,918). The 3-month Oswestry score was the strongest and most consistent predictor associated with 12-month outcomes. All prognostic models performed well with overfitting-corrected c-index values ranging from 0.718 to 0.795 and all optimism corrected calibration slopes over 0.92. The increase in c-index values ranged from 0.09 to 0.21 when adding 3-month patient-reported outcome scores. CONCLUSIONS: Models had good discrimination and were well calibrated for estimating 12-month disability, back pain, leg pain, and satisfaction. Patient-reported outcomes at 3 months after surgery, especially 3-month Oswestry scores, improved the 12-month performance of all prognostic models beyond using only baseline variables.},

Experimental Design for the Life Sciences equips you with the skills you need to effectively design experiments, making this essential aspect of the research process readily understandable. It demonstrates how good experimental design relies on clear thinking and biological understanding, not mathematical or statistical complexity. With a refreshingly approachable and articulate style, the book walks you through the considerations that go into designing an experiment in clear, practical terms. Using examples drawn from across the life sciences - from ecology, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and health sciences - the authors illustrate how these concepts are applied within the broad context of real biological research.Online Resource CentreThe Online Resource centre to accompany Experimental Design for the Life Sciences features:For students: DT Self-test questions and answersDT Additional examplesDT Supplementary sections discuss complex concepts and statistical issues in more depthDT Links to useful websites and free softwareFor lecturers:DT Suggested course structures, complete with practical exercisesDT Figures from the book, available to download             Previous publication dates            October 2010, March 2006, February 2003},

  abstract = {When data on treatment assignment, outcomes, and covariates from a randomized trial are available, a question of interest is to what extent covariates can be used to optimize treatment decisions. Statistical hypothesis testing of covariate-by-treatment interaction is ill-suited for this purpose. The application of decision theory results in treatment rules that compare the expected benefit of treatment given the patient's covariates against a treatment threshold. However, determining treatment threshold is often context-specific, and any given threshold might seem arbitrary when the overall capacity towards predicting treatment benefit is of concern. We propose the Concentration of Benefit index (Cb), a threshold-free metric that quantifies the combined performance of covariates towards finding individuals who will benefit the most from treatment. The construct of the proposed index is comparing expected treatment outcomes with and without knowledge of covariates when one of a two randomly selected patients is to be treated. We show that the resulting index can also be expressed in terms of the integrated efficiency of individualized treatment decision over the entire range of treatment thresholds. We propose parametric and semiparametric estimators, the latter being suitable for out-of-sample validation and correction for optimism. We used data from a clinical trial to demonstrate the calculations in a step-by-step fashion https://github.com/msadatsafavi/txBenefit. The proposed index has intuitive and theoretically sound interpretation and can be estimated with relative ease for a wide class of regression models. Beyond the conceptual developments, various aspects of estimation and inference for such a metric need to be pursued in future research. R code that implements the method for a variety of regression models is provided at (https://github.com/msadatsafavi/txBenefit).},

  abstract = {The global burden of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has not been studied previously. Such information is important given the emergence of cardiovascular diseases in developing countries. We conducted a systematic literature review and estimated the global and regional incidence and prevalence of AAA in 21 world regions by age and sex. The search for prevalence and incidence of AAA using standard clinical and epidemiological terms was conducted using MEDLINE (1950 to 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010), AMED (1985 to 2010), CINAHL (1982 to 2010), and LILACS (2008 to 2010). Data abstracted from the systematic review served as priors for Bayesian meta-regression analyses. The analysis drew from 26 high-quality studies to estimate AAA prevalence and incidence. In 1990, the global age-specific prevalence rate per 100,000 ranged from 8.43 (95\% CI: 7.03 to 10.14) in the 40 to 44 years age group to 2,422.53 (95\% CI: 2,298.63 to 2,562.25) in the 75 to 79 years age group; the corresponding range in 2010 was 7.88 (95\% CI: 6.54 to 9.59) to 2,274.82 (95\% CI: 2,149.77 to 2,410.17). Prevalence was higher in developed versus developing nations, and the rates within each development stratum decreased between 1990 and 2010. Globally, the age-specific annual incidence rate per 100,000 in 1990 ranged from 0.89 (95\% CI: 0.66 to 1.17) in 40 to 44 years age group to 176.08 (95\% CI: 162.72 to 190.28) in the 75 to 79 years age group. In 2010, this range was 0.83 (95\% CI: 0.61 to 1.11) to 164.57 (95\% CI: 152.20 to 178.78). The highest prevalence in 1990 was in Australasia and North America high income regions: 382.65 (95\% CI: 356.27 to 410.88) and 300.59 (95\% CI: 280.93 to 321.54), respectively. Australasia had the highest prevalence in 2010, although the prevalence decreased to 310.27 (95\% CI: 289.01 to 332.94). Regional prevalence increased in Oceania, tropical Latin America, Asia Pacific high income, Southern Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Central SSA, South Asia, Western SSA, and Central Asia. AAA global prevalence and incidence rates have decreased over the last 20 years. However, rising rates in some regions highlight the need for policies to enhance global disease surveillance and prevention.},

  abstract = {Vasa vasorum (VV) vessels are critical in the genesis of atherosclerosis. Therefore, we assessed measures of carotid VV, intima-media thickness (CIMT), and patient risk factors in a primary prevention population. We used multivariable linear models to evaluate the relationship between baseline covariates and a measure of carotid VV (VV ratio) and CIMT among 324 diabetics and 141 nondiabetics. Median CIMT (in mm) and VV ratio among nondiabetics were 0.82 Â± 0.22 and 0.80 Â± 0.19, respectively, and 1.06 Â± 0.19 and 1.21 Â± 0.26 among diabetics (P {$<$} 0.0001). Diabetes was associated with 36\% (95\% CI: 24.3-48.0, P {$<$} 0.001) higher VV ratio whereas a unit change in BMI was associated with â1\% (95\% CI: 0.5-1.4, P {$<$} 0.001) change in VV ratio. A 10-year increase in age was associated with 4\% (95\% CI: 1-7, P = 0.005) higher CIMT. Each 10 mmHg increase in mean systolic blood pressure was associated with 2\% (95\% CI: 1-4, P = 0.003) higher CIMT whereas diabetes conferred 31\% (95\% CI: 19.1-42.1, P {$<$} 0.001) higher CIMT. Female sex was associated with a 9\% (95\% CI: -12.9 to -4.1, P {$<$} 0.001) lower CIMT. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, and CIMT were not significantly associated with VV ratio. In this cohort of patients with low CIMT, VV ratio, and CIMT were distinctly unrelated, but each independently associated with diabetes. VV ratio and CIMT relationships warrant further investigation in large-scale studies and across a spectrum of atherosclerostic states.  2014, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The optimal clinical and statistical situation for the design of such a trial is one that starts with the selection of a single primary efficacy endpoint that completely characterizes the disease under study, admits the most efficient clinical and statistical evaluation of treatment effect, and provides clear and broad interpretation of drug effect. For diseases with multidimensional presentations, however, the selection of such an endpoint may not be possible, and so drug effectiveness is often characterized by the use of composite or multiple efficacy endpoint(s). The use of a composite endpoint with components that are only slightly correlated but not quite dissimilar in their recognized clinical relevance could lead to a more sensitive statistical test and thus, adequately powered trials with smaller sample size. This note discusses the utility of composite endpoints in clinical trials and some of the common approaches for dealing with multiplicity arising from their use.},

These factors create an ever-increasing risk for errors in code and the sensitivity of findings to data preparation and the execution of complex statistical and computing methods. The consequences of coding and data mistakes can be substantial. In this paper, we describe the key steps for implementing a code quality assurance (QA) process that researchers can follow to improve their coding practices throughout a project to assure the quality of the final data, code, analyses, and results. These steps include: (i) adherence to principles for code writing and style that follow best practices; (ii) clear written documentation that describes code, workflow, and key analytic decisions; (iii) careful version control; (iv) good data management; and (v) regular testing and review. Following these steps will greatly improve the ability of a study to assure results are accurate and reproducible. The responsibility for code QA falls not only on individual researchers but institutions, journals, and funding agencies as well.},

The stated goal of this operation is to provide unitless covariates to compare like with like, especially when penalized likelihood or prior distributions are used. We contend that this vision is too simplistic. Instead, we propose to take into account a more essential component of the structure of the regression matrix by rescaling the covariates based on the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix Î£ of the maximum-likelihood estimator. We illustrate the differences between the standard Ï and proposed Î£-rescalings with various estimators and data sets.},

  abstract = {Background: How to select variables and identify functional forms for continuous variables is a key concern when creating a multivariable model. Ad hoc 'traditional' approaches to variable selection have been in use for at least 50\,years. Similarly, methods for determining functional forms for continuous variables were first suggested many years ago. More recently, many alternative approaches to address these two challenges have been proposed, but knowledge of their properties and meaningful comparisons between them are scarce. To define a state of the art and to provide evidence-supported guidance to researchers who have only a basic level of statistical knowledge, many outstanding issues in multivariable modelling remain. Our main aims are to identify and illustrate such gaps in the literature and present them at a moderate technical level to the wide community of practitioners, researchers and students of statistics. Methods: We briefly discuss general issues in building descriptive regression models, strategies for variable selection, different ways of choosing functional forms for continuous variables and methods for combining the selection of variables and functions. We discuss two examples, taken from the medical literature, to illustrate problems in the practice of modelling. Results: Our overview revealed that there is not yet enough evidence on which to base recommendations for the selection of variables and functional forms in multivariable analysis. Such evidence may come from comparisons between alternative methods. In particular, we highlight seven important topics that require further investigation and make suggestions for the direction of further research. Conclusions: Selection of variables and of functional forms are important topics in multivariable analysis. To define a state of the art and to provide evidence-supported guidance to researchers who have only a basic level of statistical knowledge, further comparative research is required.},

To achieve consistency, practitioners must either assume that no units exist with propensity scores greater than one-half or assume that there is no confounding among such units. The result is not driven by the use of propensity scores, and similar artifacts arise when matching on other scores as long as it is without replacement.},

  abstract = {Discrimination measures for continuous time-to-event outcomes have become an important tool in medical decision making. The idea behind discrimination measures is to evaluate the performance of a prediction model by measuring its ability to distinguish between observations having an event and those having no event. Researchers proposed a variety of approaches to estimate discrimination measures from a set of right-censored data. These approaches rely on different regularity assumptions that are needed to ensure consistency of the respective estimators. Typical examples of regularity assumptions include the proportional hazards assumption in Cox regression and the random censoring assumption. Because regularity assumptions are often violated in practice, conducting a sensitivity analysis of the estimators is of considerable interest. The aim of the paper is to analyze and to compare the most popular estimators of discrimination measures for event time outcomes. On the basis of the results of an extensive simulation study and the analysis of molecular data, we investigate the behavior of the estimators in situations where the underlying regularity assumptions do not hold. We show that violations of the regularity assumptions may induce a nonignorable bias and may therefore result in biased medical decision making.},

  abstract = {Fasting glucose is the standard measure used to diagnose diabetes in the United States. Recently, glycated hemoglobin was also recommended for this purpose. We compared the prognostic value of glycated hemoglobin and fasting glucose for identifying adults at risk for diabetes or cardiovascular disease. We measured glycated hemoglobin in whole-blood samples from 11,092 black or white adults who did not have a history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease and who attended the second visit (occurring in the 1990-1992 period) of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. The glycated hemoglobin value at baseline was associated with newly diagnosed diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes. For glycated hemoglobin values of less than 5.0\%, 5.0 to less than 5.5\%, 5.5 to less than 6.0\%, 6.0 to less than 6.5\%, and 6.5\% or greater, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (with 95\% confidence intervals) for diagnosed diabetes were 0.52 (0.40 to 0.69), 1.00 (reference), 1.86 (1.67 to 2.08), 4.48 (3.92 to 5.13), and 16.47 (14.22 to 19.08), respectively. For coronary heart disease, the hazard ratios were 0.96 (0.74 to 1.24), 1.00 (reference), 1.23 (1.07 to 1.41), 1.78 (1.48 to 2.15), and 1.95 (1.53 to 2.48), respectively. The hazard ratios for stroke were similar. In contrast, glycated hemoglobin and death from any cause were found to have a J-shaped association curve. All these associations remained significant after adjustment for the baseline fasting glucose level. The association between the fasting glucose levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease or death from any cause was not significant in models with adjustment for all covariates as well as glycated hemoglobin. For coronary heart disease, measures of risk discrimination showed significant improvement when glycated hemoglobin was added to models including fasting glucose. In this community-based population of nondiabetic adults, glycated hemoglobin was similarly associated with a risk of diabetes and more strongly associated with risks of cardiovascular disease and death from any cause as compared with fasting glucose. These data add to the evidence supporting the use of glycated hemoglobin as a diagnostic test for diabetes.},

This transformation at the point of medical decision-making will require auxiliary information on the level of background risk of the patient."; p. 3748:"The decision to fit prognostic factors has a far more dramatic effect on the precision of our inferences than the choice of an allocation based on covariates or randomization approach and one of my chief objections to the allocation based on covariates approach is that trialists have tended to use the fact that they have balanced as an excuse for not fitting. This is a grave mistake."}

This does not seem to follow logically although it has certainly been the tradition. If a drug changes heart rate and this is prognostic of bad outcomes for the patient, and if correcting for the change in heart rate removes a bad prognostic effect of QT changes, can it not be a mistake to correct for heart rate changes? A good deal of the paper rests on the between-patient variance being greater than zero. The confidence interval for d11 is [.0018,.0190] which goes fairly close to zero. Isn't there a boundary problem at zero with MLE or REML estimates of variances? Has the confidence coverage of such confidence intervals (both tails being 0.025) been verified by simulation? Your model in section 4.2 is on the QT scale but your other models were on the log QT scale. How do you know which scale is appropriate for section 4.2? You have a lot of heart cycles per subject available for analysis. I am unclear how many were used per subject when fitting equation (3). It would make sense to use hundreds of cycles per subject when modeling within-patient heart rate dependency on QT intervals.}

  abstract = {Cardiovascular randomized controlled trials (RCTs) typically set composite end points as the primary outcome to enhance statistical power. However, influence of individual component end points on overall composite outcomes remains understudied. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE for RCTs published in 6 high-impact journals (The Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, Circulation, Journal of the American College of Cardiology and the European Heart Journal) from 2011 to 2017. Two-armed, parallel-design cardiovascular RCTs which reported composite outcomes were included. All-cause or cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke were deemed "hard" end points, whereas hospitalization, angina, and revascularization were identified as "soft" end points. Type of outcome (primary or secondary), event rates in treatment and control groups for the composite outcome and of its components according to predefined criteria. RESULTS: Of the 45.8\% (316/689) cardiovascular RCTs which used a composite outcome, 79.4\% set the composite as the primary outcome. Death was the most common component (89.8\%) followed by myocardial infarction (66.1\%). About 80\% of the trials reported complete data for each component. One hundred forty-seven trials (46.5\%) incorporated a "soft" end point as part of their composite. Death contributed the least to the estimate of effects (R2 change\,=\,0.005) of the composite, whereas revascularization contributed the most (R2 change\,=\,0.423). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular RCTs frequently use composite end points, which include "soft" end points, as components in nearly 50\% of studies. Higher event rates in composite end points may create a misleading interpretation of treatment impact due to large contributions from end points with less clinical significance.},

  abstract = {Prospective randomized clinical trials addressing biomarkers are time consuming and costly, but are necessary for regulatory agencies to approve new therapies with predictive biomarkers. For this reason, recently, there have been many discussions and proposals of various trial designs and comparisons of their efficiency in the literature. We compare statistical efficiencies between the marker-stratified design and the marker-based precision medicine design regarding testing/estimating 4 hypotheses/parameters of clinical interest, namely, treatment effects in each marker-positive and marker-negative cohorts, marker-by-treatment interaction, and the marker's clinical utility. As may be expected, the stratified design is more efficient than the precision medicine design. However, it is perhaps surprising to find out how low the relative efficiency can be for the precision medicine design. We quantify the relative efficiency as a function of design factors including the marker-positive prevalence rate, marker assay and classification sensitivity and specificity, and the treatment randomization ratio. It is interesting to examine the trends of the relative efficiency with these design parameters in testing different hypotheses. We advocate to use the stratified design over the precision medicine design in clinical trials with predictive biomarkers.},

  abstract = {We discuss a decision-theoretic approach to building a panel-based, preemptive genotyping program. The method is based on findings that a large percentage of patients are prescribed medications that are known to have pharmacogenetic associations, and over time, a substantial proportion are prescribed additional such medication. Preemptive genotyping facilitates genotype-guided therapy at the time medications are prescribed; panel-based testing allows providers to reuse previously collected genetic data when a new indication arises. Because it is cost-prohibitive to conduct panel-based genotyping on all patients, we describe a three-step approach to identify patients with the highest anticipated benefit. First, we construct prediction models to estimate the risk of being prescribed one of the target medications using readily available clinical data. Second, we use literature-based estimates of adverse event rates, variant allele frequencies, secular death rates, and costs to construct a discrete event simulation that estimates the expected benefit of having an individual's genetic data in the electronic health record after an indication has occurred. Finally, we combine medication prescription risk with expected benefit of genotyping once a medication is indicated to calculate the expected benefit of preemptive genotyping. For each patient-clinic visit, we calculate this expected benefit across a range of medications and select patients with the highest expected benefit overall. We build a proof of concept implementation using a cohort of patients from a single academic medical center observed from July 2010 through December 2012. We then apply the results of our modeling strategy to show the extent to which we can improve clinical and economic outcomes in a cohort observed from January 2013 through December 2015.},

  abstract = {Chatterjee (2021+) introduced a simple new rank correlation coefficient that has attracted much recent attention. The coefficient has the unusual appeal that it not only estimates a population quantity first proposed by Dette et al. (2013) that is zero if and only if the underlying pair of random variables is independent, but also is asymptotically normal under independence. This paper compares Chatterjeeâs new correlation coefficient to three established rank correlations that also facilitate consistent tests of independence, namely, Hoeffdingâs D, BlumâKieferâ Rosenblattâs R, and BergsmaâDassiosâYanagimotoâs Ï *. We contrast their computational efficiency in light of recent advances, and investigate their power against local rotation and mixture alternatives. Our main results show that Chatterjeeâs coefficient is unfortunately rate sub-optimal compared to D, R, and Ï *. The situation is more subtle for a related earlier estimator of Dette et al. (2013). These results favor D, R, and Ï * over Chatterjeeâs new correlation coefficient for the purpose of testing independence.},

  abstract = {N-of-1 trials, which are randomized, double-blinded, controlled, multiperiod, crossover trials on a single subject, have been applied to determine the heterogeneity of the individual's treatment effect in precision medicine settings. An aggregated N-of-1 design, which can estimate the population effect from these individual trials, is a pragmatic alternative when a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is infeasible. We propose a Bayesian adaptive design for both the individual and aggregated N-of-1 trials using a multiarmed bandit framework that is estimated via efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo. A Bayesian hierarchical structure is used to jointly model the individual and population treatment effects. Our proposed adaptive trial design is based on Thompson sampling, which randomly allocates individuals to treatments based on the Bayesian posterior probability of each treatment being optimal. While we use a subject-specific treatment effect and Bayesian posterior probability estimates to determine an individual's treatment allocation, our hierarchical model facilitates these individual estimates to borrow strength from the population estimates via shrinkage to the population mean. We present the design's operating characteristics and performance via a simulation study motivated by a recently completed N-of-1 clinical trial. We demonstrate that from a patient-centered perspective, subjects are likely to benefit from our adaptive design, in particular, for those individuals that deviate from the overall population effect.},

Many students are confused by the central limit theorem, thinking it applies to both type I and II errors when it only applies to type I.

  abstract = {Objective Body mass index (BMI) is the most commonly used predictor of weight-related comorbidities and outcomes. However, the presumed relationship between height and weight intrinsic to BMI may introduce bias with respect to prediction of clinical outcomes. A series of analyses comparing the performance of models representing weight and height as separate interacting variables to models using BMI were performed using Vanderbilt University Medical Center's deidentified electronic health records and landmark methodology. Methods Use of BMI or height-weight interaction in prediction models for established weight-related cardiometabolic traits and metabolic syndrome was evaluated. Specifically, prediction models for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, low high-density lipoprotein, and elevated triglycerides, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral artery disease were developed. Model performance was evaluated using likelihood ratio, R2, and Somers' Dxy rank correlation. Differences in model predictions were visualized using heat maps. Results Compared to BMI, the maximally flexible height-weight interaction model demonstrated improved prediction, higher likelihood ratio, R2, and Somers' Dxy rank correlation, for event-free probability for all outcomes. The degree of improvement to the prediction model differed based on the outcome and across the height and weight range. Conclusions Because alternative measures of body composition such as waist-to-hip ratio are not routinely collected in the clinic clinical risk models quantifying risk based on height and weight measurements alone are essential to improve practice. Compared to BMI, modeling height and weight as independent, interacting variables results in less bias and improved predictive accuracy for all tested traits. Considering an individual's height and weight opposed to BMI is a better method for quantifying individual disease risk.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reducing length of stay (LOS) in a safe manner has the potential to save significant costs for the care of patients undergoing elective lumbar spine surgery. Due to the relative absence on weekends of staff required for discharging patients to rehabilitation or nursing facilities, we hypothesize that patients undergoing lumbar surgery later in the week have a longer LOS than their counterparts. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of day of the week for lumbar surgery on LOS. METHODS: Patients undergoing surgery for lumbar degenerative disease were prospectively enrolled in the multicenter quality and outcomes database registry. A multivariable proportional odds regression model was built with LOS as the outcome of interest and patient and surgical variables as covariates. RESULTS: A total of 11 897 patients were analyzed. Among those discharged home, the regression analysis demonstrated significantly higher odds of longer LOS for patients undergoing surgery on Friday as compared to Monday (P~{$<~$}.001). Among those discharged to a facility, there were significantly higher odds of longer LOS for patients undergoing surgery on Wednesday (P~{$<~$}.001), Thursday (P~{$<~$}.001), and Friday (P~=~.002) as compared to Monday. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that lumbar patients undergoing fusions and those discharged to a facility have longer LOS when surgery is later in the week. Scheduling these patients for surgery earlier in the week and ensuring adequate resources for patient disposition on weekends may lead to LOS reduction and cost savings for hospitals, payers, and patients alike.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: This study retrospectively analyzes prospectively collected data. OBJECTIVE: Here we aim to develop predictive models for 3-month medical and surgical readmission after elective lumbar surgery, based on a multi-institutional, national spine registry. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Unplanned readmissions place considerable stress on payers, hospitals, and patients. Medicare data reveals a 30-day readmission rate of 7.8\% for lumbar-decompressions and 13.0\% for lumbar-fusions, and hospitals are now being penalized for excessive 30-day readmission rates by virtue of the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. METHODS: The Quality and Outcomes Database (QOD) was queried for patients undergoing elective lumbar surgery for degenerative diseases. The QOD prospectively captures 3-month readmissions through electronic medical record (EMR) review and self-reported outcome questionnaires. Distinct multivariable logistic regression models were fitted for surgery-related and medical readmissions adjusting for patient and surgery-specific variables. RESULTS: Of the total 33,674 patients included in this study 2079 (6.15\%) reported at least one readmission during the 90-day postoperative period. The odds of medical readmission were significantly higher for older patients, males versus females, African Americans versus Caucasion, those with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, diabetes, coronary artery disease, higher numbers of involved levels, anterior only or anterior-posterior versus posterior approach; also, for patients who were unemployed compared with employed patients and those with high baseline Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The odds of surgery-related readmission were significantly greater for patients with a higher body mass index (BMI), a higher ASA grade, female versus male, and African Americans versus Caucasians; also, for patients with severe depression, more involved spinal levels, anterior-only surgical approaches and higher baseline ODI scores. CONCLUSION: In this study we present internally validated predictive models for medical and surgical readmission after elective lumbar spine surgery. These findings set the stage for targeted interventions with a potential to reduce unnecessary readmissions, and also suggest that medical and surgical readmissions be treated as distinct clinical events.

OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study is to present a scheme for patient-reported outcome (PRO)-based, risk-adjusted rankings of spine surgeons and sites that perform elective lumbar surgery, using the Quality and Outcomes Database (QOD). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is currently no means of determining which spine surgeons or centers are positive or negative outliers with respect to PROs for elective lumbar surgery. This is a critical gap as we move toward a value-based model of health care in which providers assume more accountability for the effectiveness of their treatments. METHODS: Random effects regression models were fit for the following outcomes, with QOD site as a fixed effect but surgeon ID as a random effect: Oswestry Disability Index, EQ-5D, back pain and leg pain, and satisfaction. Hierarchical Bayesian models were also fit for each outcome, with QOD site as a random effect and surgeon as a nested random effect. RESULTS: Our study cohort consists of 8834 patients who underwent surgery by 124 QOD surgeons, for the degenerative lumbar diseases. Nonoverlapping Bayesian credible intervals demonstrate that the variance attributed to QOD site was greater than the nested variance attributed to surgeon ID for the included PROs. CONCLUSION: This study presents a novel strategy for the risk-adjusted, PRO-based ranking of spine surgeons and practices. This can help identify positive and negative outliers, thereby forming the basis for large-scale quality improvement. Assuming adequate coverage of baseline risk adjustment, the choice of surgeon matters when considering PROs after lumbar surgery; however, the choice of site appears to matter more.

  abstract = {In observational studies of the effect of an exposure on an outcome, the exposureâoutcome association is usually confounded by other causes of the outcome (potential confounders). One common method to increase efficiency is to match the study on potential confounders. Matched case-control studies are relatively common and well covered by the literature. Matched cohort studies are less common but do sometimes occur. It is often argued that it is valid to ignore the matching variables, in the analysis of matched cohort data. In this paper, we provide analyses delineating the scope and limits of this argument. We discuss why the argument does not carry over to effect estimation in matched case-control studies, although it does carry over to null-hypothesis testing. We also show how the argument does not extend to matched cohort studies when one adjusts for additional confounders in the analysis. Ignoring the matching variables can sometimes reduce variance, even though this is not guaranteed. We investigate the trade-off between bias and variance in deciding whether adjustment for matching factors is advisable.},

  note = {From the Conclusion section: ââ¦ignoring the matching variables ina cohort study can leave bias if there are additional confounders, even with adjustment for the additionalconfounders. This bias can be avoided by adjusting for the matching variables.For linear and logistic models, we have shown that the bias induced by ignoring the matching vari-ables can be outweighed by variance reduction, but this is not guaranteed. For linear models we observedthat on average we tend to increase MSE when ignoring the matching variable. For logistic models weobserved no major impact on average of ignoring the matching variable. Thus, as a tentative heuristicwe would recommend some adjustment for the matching variables when analyzing matched cohort data,although a matched analyses per se is not needed.â}

  abstract = {Epidemiologists aim to identify modifiable causes of disease, this often being a prerequisite for the application of epidemiological findings in public health programmes, health service planning and clinical medicine. Despite successes in identifying causes, it is often claimed that there are missing additional causes for even reasonably well-understood conditions such as lung cancer and coronary heart disease. Several lines of evidence suggest that largely chance events, from the biographical down to the sub-cellular, contribute an important stochastic element to disease risk that is not epidemiologically tractable at the individual level. Epigenetic influences provide a fashionable contemporary explanation for such seemingly random processes. Chance eventsâsuch as a particular lifelong smoker living unharmed to 100 yearsâare averaged out at the group level. As a consequence population-level differences (for example, secular trends or differences between administrative areas) can be entirely explicable by causal factors that appear to account for only a small proportion of individual-level risk. In public health terms, a modifiable cause of the large majority of cases of a disease may have been identified, with a wild goose chase continuing in an attempt to discipline the random nature of the world with respect to which particular individuals will succumb. The quest for personalized medicine is a contemporary manifestation of this dream. An evolutionary explanation of why randomness exists in the development of organisms has long been articulated, in terms of offering a survival advantage in changing environments. Further, the basic notion that what is near-random at one level may be almost entirely predictable at a higher level is an emergent property of many systems, from particle physics to the social sciences. These considerations suggest that epidemiological approaches will remain fruitful as we enter the decade of the epigenome.},

Incidence or time to a particular health state are commonly used outcomes but the choice of health state may not be obvious and these estimands do not make full use of the longitudinal assessments. Multistate models have been developed for some diseases and conditions with the purpose of understanding their natural history and have been used for secondary analysis to understand mechanisms of action of treatments. There is little published on the use of multistate models as the primary analysis method and potential implications on design features, such as assessment schedules. We illustrate methods via analysis of data from a motivating example; a Phase III clinical trial of pressure ulcer prevention strategies. We clarify some of the possible estimands that might be considered and we show, via a simulation study, that under some circumstances the sample size could be reduced by half using a multistate model based analysis, without adversely affecting the power of the trial.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the ISCHEMIA trial, an invasive strategy with angiographic assessment and revascularization did not reduce clinical events among patients with stable ischemic heart disease and moderate or severe ischemia. A secondary objective of the trial was to assess angina-related health status among these patients. METHODS: We assessed angina-related symptoms, function, and quality of life with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) at randomization, at months 1.5, 3, and 6, and every 6 months thereafter in participants who had been randomly assigned to an invasive treatment strategy (2295 participants) or a conservative strategy (2322). Mixed-effects cumulative probability models within a Bayesian framework were used to estimate differences between the treatment groups. The primary outcome of this health-status analysis was the SAQ summary score (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status). All analyses were performed in the overall population and according to baseline angina frequency. RESULTS: At baseline, 35\% of patients reported having no angina in the previous month. SAQ summary scores increased in both treatment groups, with increases at 3, 12, and 36 months that were 4.1 points (95\% credible interval, 3.2 to 5.0), 4.2 points (95\% credible interval, 3.3 to 5.1), and 2.9 points (95\% credible interval, 2.2 to 3.7) higher with the invasive strategy than with the conservative strategy. Differences were larger among participants who had more frequent angina at baseline (8.5 vs. 0.1 points at 3 months and 5.3 vs. 1.2 points at 36 months among participants with daily or weekly angina as compared with no angina). CONCLUSIONS: In the overall trial population with moderate or severe ischemia, which included 35\% of participants without angina at baseline, patients randomly assigned to the invasive strategy had greater improvement in angina-related health status than those assigned to the conservative strategy. The modest mean differences favoring the invasive strategy in the overall group reflected minimal differences among asymptomatic patients and larger differences among patients who had had angina at baseline.

  abstract = {Injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) threatens an active lifestyle and exposes the patient to risk of early osteoarthritis (OA). ACL reconstruction is typically chosen by individuals to allow a return to their previous work and sports activities. Primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR) has in general been effective at restoring functional stability, but patients' modifiable predictors of both short- and long-term validated outcomes and OA are largely unknown. The Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) consortium was established in 2002 to enroll and longitudinally follow a population cohort of ACL reconstructed patients. The objective was to establish patient-specific predictive models of clinically important outcomes. Over the past 10 years, the overarching aims of this NIAMS-funded prospective multicenter cohort of ACL reconstructions has been threefold: (1) to identify both short- and long-term prognosis and predictors of sports function, activity level, and general health through validated patient-reported outcomes, (2) to identify the symptoms and signs of OA, and (3) to quantify the incidence of ACL reconstruction graft and/or contralateral ACL failures and additional surgical procedures. This manuscript summarizes the Kappa Delta Ann Doner Vaughan Award paper and presentation at the 2012 ORS/AAOS Annual Meeting.},

  abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

  abstract = {We performed a simulation study to investigate the accuracy of bootstrap estimates of optimism (internal validation) and the precision of performance estimates in independent validation samples (external validation). We combined two data sets containing children presenting with fever without source ( n \textasciitilde =~376~+~179~=~555; 120 bacterial infections). Random samples were drawn from this combined data set for the development ( n \textasciitilde =~376) and validation ( n \textasciitilde =~179) of logistic regression models. The models included statistically significant predictors for infection selected from a set of 57 candidate predictors. Model development, including the selection of predictors, and validation were repeated in a bootstrapping procedure. The resulting expected optimism estimate in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area was compared with the observed optimism according to independent validation samples. The average apparent ROC area was 0.74, which was expected (based on bootstrapping) to decrease by 0.07 to 0.67, whereas the observed decrease in the validation samples was 0.09 to 0.65. Omitting the selection of predictors from the bootstrap procedure led to a severe underestimation of the optimism (decrease 0.006). The standard error of the observed ROC area in the independent validation samples was large (0.05). We recommend bootstrapping for internal validation because it gives reasonably valid estimates of the expected optimism in predictive performance provided that any selection of predictors is taken into account. For external validation, substantial sample sizes should be used for sufficient power to detect clinically important changes in performance as compared with the internally validated estimate.},

  abstract = {The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration.Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision-analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions.We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration, we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n = 544 for model development, n = 273 for external validation).We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models provide risk estimates for the presence of disease (diagnosis) or an event in the future course of disease (prognosis) for individual patients. Although publications that present and evaluate such models are becoming more frequent, the methodology is often suboptimal. We propose that seven steps should be considered in developing prediction models: (i) consideration of the research question and initial data inspection; (ii) coding of predictors; (iii) model specification; (iv) model estimation; (v) evaluation of model performance; (vi) internal validation; and (vii) model presentation. The validity of a prediction model is ideally assessed in fully independent data, where we propose four key measures to evaluate model performance: calibration-in-the-large, or the model intercept (A); calibration slope (B); discrimination, with a concordance statistic (C); and clinical usefulness, with decision-curve analysis (D). As an application, we develop and validate prediction models for 30-day mortality in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. This illustrates the usefulness of the proposed framework to strengthen the methodological rigour and quality for prediction models in cardiovascular research.

  abstract = {Exchanges of practical or financial help between people living in different households are a major component of intergenerational exchanges within families and an increasingly important source of support for individuals in need. Using longitudinal data, bivariate dynamic panel models can be applied to study the effects of changes in individual circumstances on help given to and received from non-coresident parents and the reciprocity of exchanges. However, the use of a rotating module for collection of data on exchanges leads to data where the response measurements are unequally spaced and taken less frequently than for the time-varying covariates. Existing approaches to this problem focus on fixed effects linear models for univariate continuous responses. We propose a random effects estimator for a family of dynamic panel models that can handle continuous, binary or ordinal multivariate responses. The performance of the estimator is assessed in a simulation study. A bivariate probit dynamic panel model is then applied to estimate the effects of partnership and employment transitions in the previous year and the presence and age of children in the current year on an individualâs propensity to give or receive help. Annual data on respondentsâ partnership, employment status and dependent children, and data on exchanges of help collected at 2- and 5-year intervals are used in this study.},

By use of the Social Security Master Death Index, mortality was examined in 286,443 non-smoking insurance applicants aged 40 and up for whom blood samples for hemoglobin A1c were submitted to the Clinical Reference Laboratory. Results were stratified by hemoglobin A1c value, gender and age bands 40 to 59, 60 to 69 and 70 and up.  Increased mortality is apparent at hemoglobin A1c values of 6\% and above, is linear, and on a percentage basis decreases with age. Hemoglobin A1c values less than 5\% also are associated with increased mortality. Absolute mortality rates for females with elevated hemoglobin A1c are generally lower than rates for males, although mortality relative to the gender-specific reference group with hemoglobin A1c of 5\% to 5.9\% is generally the same for both.  The importance of even small elevations of hemoglobin A1c above 5.9\% is apparent. For screening, it is the degree of blood sugar elevation as measured by hemoglobin A1c rather than any diagnostic label that is critical in risk assessment.},

  abstract = {We describe the Bedside Patient Rescue (BPR) project, the goal of which is risk prediction of adverse events for non-intensive care unit patients using â¼100 variables (vitals, lab results, assessments, etc.). There are several missing predictor values for most patients, which in the health sciences is the norm, rather than the exception. A Bayesian approach is presented that addresses many of the shortcomings to standard approaches to missing predictors: (i) treatment of the uncertainty due to imputation is straight-forward in the Bayesian paradigm, (ii) the predictor distribution is flexibly modeled as an infinite normal mixture with latent variables to explicitly account for discrete predictors (i.e., as in multivariate probit regression models), and (iii) certain missing not at random situations can be handled effectively by allowing the indicator of missingness into the predictor distribution only to inform the distribution of the missing variables. The proposed approach also has the benefit of providing a distribution for the prediction, including the uncertainty inherent in the imputation. Therefore, we can ask questions such as: is it possible this individual is at high risk but we are missing too much information to know for sure? How much would we reduce the uncertainty in our risk prediction by obtaining a particular missing value? This approach is applied to the BPR problem resulting in excellent predictive capability to identify deteriorating patients.

  abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) is increasingly being used to handle missing data in epidemiologic research. When data on both the exposure and the outcome are missing, an alternative to standard MI is the âmultiple imputation, then deletionâ (MID) method, which involves deleting imputed outcomes prior to analysis. While MID has been shown to provide efficiency gains over standard MI when analysis and imputation models are the same, the performance of MID in the presence of auxiliary variables for the incomplete outcome is not well understood. Using simulated data, we evaluated the performance of standard MI and MID in regression settings where data were missing on both the outcome and the exposure and where an auxiliary variable associated with the incomplete outcome was included in the imputation model. When the auxiliary variable was unrelated to missingness in the outcome, both standard MI and MID produced negligible bias when estimating regression parameters, with standard MI being more efficient in most settings. However, when the auxiliary variable was also associated with missingness in the outcome, alarmingly MID produced markedly biased parameter estimates. On the basis of these results, we recommend that researchers use standard MI rather than MID in the presence of auxiliary variables associated with an incomplete outcome.},

Therapeutic knowledge and drug mechanism play a crucial role in determining the strategy and defining the estimand for clinical trial designs. Clinical trials in patients with hematological malignancies often present unique challenges for trial design due to complexity of treatment options and existence of potential curative but highly risky procedures, for example, stem cell transplant or treatment sequence across different phases (induction, consolidation, maintenance). Here, we illustrate how to apply the estimand framework in hematological clinical trials and how the estimand framework can address potential difficulties in trial result interpretation. This paper is a result of a cross-industry collaboration to connect the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E9 addendum concepts to applications. Three randomized phase 3 trials will be used to consider common challenges including intercurrent events in hematologic oncology trials to illustrate different scientific questions and the consequences of the estimand choice for trial design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Template language for describing estimand in both study protocols and statistical analysis plans is suggested for statisticians' reference.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of gene localization, the reliability of locus-specific effect estimates, and the ability to replicate initial claims of linkage and/or association have emerged as major methodological concerns in genomewide studies of complex diseases and quantitative traits. To address the issue of multiple comparisons inherent in genomewide studies, the use of stringent criteria for assessing statistical significance has been generally acknowledged as a strategy to control type I error. However, the application of genomewide significance criteria does not take account of the selection bias introduced into parameter estimates, e.g., estimates of locus-specific effect size of disease/trait loci. Some have argued that reliable locus-specific parameter estimates can only be obtained in an independent sample. In this report, we examine statistical resampling techniques, including cross-validation and the bootstrap, applied to the initial sample to improve the estimation of locus-specific effects. We compare them with the naÃ¯ve method in which all data are used for both hypothesis testing and parameter estimation, as well as with the split-sample approach in which part of the data are reserved for estimation. Upward bias of the naÃ¯ve estimator and inadequacy of the split-sample approach are derived analytically under a simple quantitative trait model. Simulation studies of the resampling methods are performed for both the simple model and a more realistic genomewide linkage analysis. Our results suggest that cross-validation and bootstrap methods can substantially reduce the estimation bias, especially when the effect size is small or there is no genetic effect.},

  abstract = {Although the randomised controlled trial is the âgold standardâ for studying the efficacy and safety of medical treatments, it is not necessarily free from bias. When patients do not follow the protocol for their assigned treatment, the resultant âtreatment contaminationâ can produce misleading findings. The methods used historically to deal with this problem, the âas treatedâ and âper protocolâ analysis techniques, are flawed and inaccurate. Intention to treat analysis is the solution most often used to analyse randomised controlled trials, but this approach ignores this issue of treatment contamination. Intention to treat analysis estimates the effect of recommending a treatment to study participants, not the effect of the treatment on those study participants who actually received it. In this article, we describe a simple yet rarely used analytical technique, the âcontamination adjusted intention to treat analysis,â which complements the intention to treat approach by producing a better estimate of the benefits and harms of receiving a treatment. This method uses the statistical technique of instrumental variable analysis to address contamination. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the current methods of addressing treatment contamination and the contamination adjusted intention to treat technique, provide examples of effective uses, and discuss how using estimates generated by contamination adjusted intention to treat analysis can improve clinical decision making and patient care.},

In oncology, for example, after a phase I dose-finding trial is completed in Caucasian patients, investigators often conduct a further phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose in Asian patients. This may be due to concerns about possible differences in treatment tolerability between populations. In this study, we propose to adaptively incorporate historical data into prior distributions assumed in a new dose-finding trial. Our proposed approach aims to appropriately borrow strength from a previous trial to improve the maximum tolerated dose determination in another patient population. We define a â historical-to-current (H-C)â parameter representing the degree of borrowing based on a retrospective analysis of previous trial data. In simulation studies, we examine the operating characteristics of the proposed method in comparison with 3 alternative approaches and assess how the H-C parameter functions across a variety of realistic settings.},

  abstract = {There is heightened interest in using next-generation sequencing technologies to identify rare variants that influence complex human diseases and traits. Meta-analysis is essential to this endeavor because large sample sizes are required for detecting associations with rare variants. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of statistical methods for meta-analysis of sequencing studies for discovering rare-variant associations. Specifically, we discuss the calculation of relevant summary statistics from participating studies, the construction of gene-level association tests, the choice of transformation for quantitative traits, the use of fixed-effects versus random-effects models, and the removal of shadow association signals through conditional analysis. We also show that meta-analysis based on properly calculated summary statistics is as powerful as joint analysis of individual-participant data. In addition, we demonstrate the performance of different meta-analysis methods by using both simulated and empirical data. We then compare four major software packages for meta-analysis of rare-variant associations?MASS, RAREMETAL, MetaSKAT, and seqMeta?in terms of the underlying statistical methodology, analysis pipeline, and software interface. Finally, we present PreMeta, a software interface that integrates the four meta-analysis packages and allows a consortium to combine otherwise incompatible summary statistics.},

  abstract = {The detection of fraud and other systematic data irregularities in clinical trials is an important issue. While awareness of the problem is growing and willingness to combat it is clear, there still appears to be a lack of detection procedures suitable for routine implementation by trial coordinators. The shortage is particularly acute for discrete data, since the majority of methods which are available have been developed for continuous responses. In this paper, we examine the suitability of existing methods for discrete outcomes and propose a new technique for questionnaire data in both an informal graphical mode and as a randomization test. This method exploits the underlying correlation structure of a questionnaire and the difficulty in fabricating such details. A data set concerning a trial of a novel drug for treatment of schizophrenia, in which the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was used to assess patient mental health, is used for illustration.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Researchers in Health Sciences and Medicine often use cohort designs to study treatment effects and changes of outcome variables over time period. The costs of these studies can be reduced by choosing an optimal number of repeated measurements over time and by selecting cohorts of subjects more efficiently with optimal design procedures. The objective of this study is to provide evidence on how to design large-scale cohort studies with budget constraints as efficiently as possible. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A linear cost function for repeated measurements is proposed, and this cost function is used in the optimization procedure. For a given budget/cost, different designs for linear mixed-effects models are compared by means of their efficiency. RESULTS: We found that adding more repeated measures is only beneficiary if the costs of selecting and measuring a new subject are much higher than the costs of obtaining an additional measurement for an already recruited subject. However, this gain in efficiency and power is not very large. CONCLUSION: Adding more cohorts or repeated measurements do not necessarily lead to a gain in efficiency of the estimated model parameters. A general guideline for the optimal choice of a cohort design in practice is required and we offer this guideline.},

We present a semiparametric statistical model for the probabilistic index which can be defined as P(YY*), where Y and Y* are independent random response variables associated with covariate patterns X and X* respectively. A link function defines the relationship between the probabilistic index and a linear predictor. Asymptotic normality of the estimators and consistency of the covariance matrix estimator are established through semiparametric theory. The model is illustrated with several examples, and the estimation theory is validated in a simulation study.},

Two transformation models have recently been proposed: semiparametric cumulative probability models (CPMs) and parametric most likely transformation models (MLTs). Both approaches model the cumulative distribution function and require specifying a link function, which implicitly assumes that the responses follow a known distribution after some monotonic transformation. However, the two approaches estimate the transformation differently. With CPMs, an ordinal regression model is fit, which essentially treats each continuous response as a unique category and therefore nonparametrically estimates the transformation; CPMs are semiparametric linear transformation models. In contrast, with MLTs, the transformation is parameterized using flexible basis functions. Conditional expectations and quantiles are readily derived from both methods on the response variable's original scale. We compare the two methods with extensive simulations. We find that both methods generally have good performance with moderate and large sample sizes. MLTs slightly outperformed CPMs in small sample sizes under correct models. CPMs tended to be somewhat more robust to model misspecification and outcome rounding. Except in the simplest situations, both methods outperform basic transformation approaches commonly used in practice. We apply both methods to an HIV biomarker study.},

  abstract = {The t-year mean survival or restricted mean survival time (RMST) has been used as an appealing summary of the survival distribution within a time window [0, t]. RMST is the patient's life expectancy until time t and can be estimated nonparametrically by the area under the Kaplan-Meier curve up to t. In a comparative study, the difference or ratio of two RMSTs has been utilized to quantify the between-group-difference as a clinically interpretable alternative summary to the hazard ratio. The choice of the time window [0, t] may be prespecified at the design stage of the study based on clinical considerations. On the other hand, after the survival data have been collected, the choice of time point t could be data-dependent. The standard inferential procedures for the corresponding RMST, which is also data-dependent, ignore this subtle yet important issue. In this paper, we clarify how to make inference about a random âparameter.â Moreover, we demonstrate that under a rather mild condition on the censoring distribution, one can make inference about the RMST up to t, where t is less than or even equal to the largest follow-up time (either observed or censored) in the study. This finding reduces the subjectivity of the choice of t empirically. The proposal is illustrated with the survival data from a primary biliary cirrhosis study, and its finite sample properties are investigated via an extensive simulation study.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic due to the novel coronavirus SARS CoV-2 has inspired remarkable breakthroughs in the development of vaccines against the virus and the launch of several phase 3 vaccine trials in Summer 2020 to evaluate vaccine efficacy (VE). Trials of vaccine candidates using mRNA delivery systems developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have shown substantial VEs of 94-95\%, leading the US Food and Drug Administration to issue Emergency Use Authorizations and subsequent widespread administration of the vaccines. As the trials continue, a key issue is the possibility that VE may wane over time. Ethical considerations dictate that trial participants be unblinded and those randomized to placebo be offered study vaccine, leading to trial protocol amendments specifying unblinding strategies. Crossover of placebo subjects to vaccine complicates inference on waning of VE. We focus on the particular features of the Moderna trial and propose a statistical framework based on a potential outcomes formulation within which we develop methods for inference on potential waning of VE over time and estimation of VE at any post-vaccination time. The framework clarifies assumptions made regarding individual- and population-level phenomena and acknowledges the possibility that subjects who are more or less likely to become infected may be crossed over to vaccine differentially over time. The principles of the framework can be adapted straightforwardly to other trials. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved},

  abstract = {This article discusses three statistical paradoxes that pervade epidemiological research: Simpson's paradox, Lord's paradox, and suppression. These paradoxes have important implications for the interpretation of evidence from observational studies. This article uses hypothetical scenarios to illustrate how the three paradoxes are different manifestations of one phenomenon â the reversal paradox â depending on whether the outcome and explanatory variables are categorical, continuous or a combination of both; this renders the issues and remedies for any one to be similar for all three. Although the three statistical paradoxes occur in different types of variables, they share the same characteristic: the association between two variables can be reversed, diminished, or enhanced when another variable is statistically controlled for. Understanding the concepts and theory behind these paradoxes provides insights into some controversial or contradictory research findings. These paradoxes show that prior knowledge and underlying causal theory play an important role in the statistical modelling of epidemiological data, where incorrect use of statistical models might produce consistent, replicable, yet erroneous results.},

  abstract = {As a result of the development of sophisticated techniques, such as multiple imputation, the interest in handling missing data in longitudinal studies has increased enormously in past years. Within the field of longitudinal data analysis, there is a current debate on whether it is necessary to use multiple imputations before performing a mixed-model analysis to analyze the longitudinal data. In the current study this necessity is evaluated. The results of mixed-model analyses with and without multiple imputation were compared with each other. Four data sets with missing values were created-one data set with missing completely at random, two data sets with missing at random, and one data set with missing not at random). In all data sets, the relationship between a continuous outcome variable and two different covariates were analyzed: a time-independent dichotomous covariate and a time-dependent continuous covariate. Although for all types of missing data, the results of the mixed-model analysis with or without multiple imputations were slightly different, they were not in favor of one of the two approaches. In addition, repeating the multiple imputations 100 times showed that the results of the mixed-model analysis with multiple imputation were quite unstable. It is not necessary to handle missing data using multiple imputations before performing a mixed-model analysis on longitudinal data.},

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;Over the last decades, the challenges in applied regression and in predictive modeling have been changing considerably: (1) More flexible regression model specifications are needed as data sizes and available information are steadily increasing, consequently demanding for more powerful computing infrastructure. (2) Full probabilistic models by means of distributional regression - rather than predicting only some underlying individual quantities from the distributions such as means or expectations - is crucial in many applications. (3) Availability of Bayesian inference has gained in importance both as an appealing framework for regularizing or penalizing complex models and estimation therein as well as a natural alternative to classical frequentist inference. However, while there has been a lot of research on all three challenges and the development of corresponding software packages, a modular software implementation that allows to easily combine all three aspects has not yet been available for the general framework of distributional regression. To fill this gap, the R package bamlss is introduced for Bayesian additive models for location, scale, and shape (and beyond) - with the name reflecting the most important distributional quantities (among others) that can be modeled with the software. At the core of the package are algorithms for highly-efficient Bayesian estimation and inference that can be applied to generalized additive models or generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape, or more general distributional regression models. However, its building blocks are designed as \&quot;Lego bricks\&quot; encompassing various distributions (exponential family, Cox, joint models, etc.), regression terms (linear, splines, random effects, tensor products, spatial fields, etc.), and estimators (MCMC, backfitting, gradient boosting, lasso, etc.). It is demonstrated how these can be easily combined to make classical models more flexible or to create new custom models for specific modeling challenges.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

The first dose was administered immediately after the first dose of epinephrine.The primary outcome was sustained return of spontaneous circulation. The secondary outcomes included survival and a favorable neurological outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-3) at 30 days and 90 days.Based on a planned interim analysis of 383 patients, the steering committee stopped the trial early due to concerns about harm in the calcium group. Of 397 adult patients randomized, 391 were included in the analyses (193 in the calcium group and 198 in the saline group; mean age, 68 [SD, 14] years; 114 [29\%] were female). There was no loss to follow-up. There were 37 patients (19\%) in the calcium group who had sustained return of spontaneous circulation compared with 53 patients (27\%) in the saline group (risk ratio, 0.72 [95\% CI, 0.49 to 1.03]; risk difference, â7.6\% [95\% CI, â16\% to 0.8\%]; P\,=\,.09). At 30 days, 10 patients (5.2\%) in the calcium group and 18 patients (9.1\%) in the saline group were alive (risk ratio, 0.57 [95\% CI, 0.27 to 1.18]; risk difference, â3.9\% [95\% CI, â9.4\% to 1.3\%]; P\,=\,.17). A favorable neurological outcome at 30 days was observed in 7 patients (3.6\%) in the calcium group and in 15 patients (7.6\%) in the saline group (risk ratio, 0.48 [95\% CI, 0.20 to 1.12]; risk difference, â4.0\% [95\% CI, â8.9\% to 0.7\%]; P\,=\,.12). Among the patients with calcium values measured who had return of spontaneous circulation, 26 (74\%) in the calcium group and 1 (2\%) in the saline group had hypercalcemia.Among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, treatment with intravenous or intraosseous calcium compared with saline did not significantly improve sustained return of spontaneous circulation. These results do not support the administration of calcium during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04153435},

  abstract = {Propensity scores are widely adopted in observational research because they enable adjustment for high-dimensional confounders without requiring models for their association with the outcome of interest. The results of statistical analyses based on stratification, matching or inverse weighting by the propensity score are therefore less susceptible to model extrapolation than those based solely on outcome regression models. This is attractive because extrapolation in outcome regression models may be alarming, yet difficult to diagnose, when the exposed and unexposed individuals have very different covariate distributions. Standard regression adjustment for the propensity score forms an alternative to the aforementioned propensity score methods, but the benefits of this are less clear because it still involves modelling the outcome in addition to the propensity score. In this article, we develop novel insights into the properties of this adjustment method. We demonstrate that standard tests of the null hypothesis of no exposure effect (based on robust variance estimators), as well as particular standardised effects obtained from such adjusted regression models, are robust against misspecification of the outcome model when a propensity score model is correctly specified; they are thus not vulnerable to the aforementioned problem of extrapolation. We moreover propose efficient estimators for these standardised effects, which retain a useful causal interpretation even when the propensity score model is misspecified, provided the outcome regression model is correctly specified.},

  note = {From first author in ASA Connections discussion:I share your concerns and also tend to favour regression adjustment for the propensity score for the following additional reasons:- it adjusts for residual confounding due to imperfect matching;- it makes more efficient use of the information in the data;- adjustment for both the propensity score and covariates can result in estimators with a double robustness property: they are valid if either the propensity score is correct or the covariates in the outcome model are correctly modelled.- matching is often preferred for simplicity, but I tend to believe that regression adjustment for the propensity score is much simpler because one loses the simplicity of matching whenever one wishes to adjust for residual confounding due to imperfect matching or wishes to obtain valid standard errors.
\par
Note that, like matching methods, regression adjustment for the propensity score also prevents the dangers of model extrapolation in settings where the treated and untreated are very different in their observed covariate data, in the sense that- subjects with covariate values at which there are nearly only treated or non-treated individuals are down-weighted, as they contribute little or no information about treatment effect;- valid estimators of treatment effect can be obtained when the propensity score model is correct, even when the association between outcome and propensity score is misspecified. This follows from the aforementioned double robustness property.}

The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of a case-finding strategy of these disorders. METHODS: This is a clustered randomized trial; 18 general practices from the vicinity of Utrecht, the Netherlands, were randomly allocated to a case-finding strategy or usual care. Multimorbid community subjects (â¥65\,years) with dyspnea or reduced exercise tolerance were eligible for inclusion. The case-finding strategy consisted of history taking, physical examination, blood tests, electrocardiography, spirometry, and echocardiography. Subsequent treatment decisions were at the discretion of the general practitioner. Questionnaires regarding health status and functionality were filled out at baseline and after 6 months of follow-up. Information regarding changes in medication and health care use during the 6 months follow-up was extracted. RESULTS: A total of 829 participants were randomized: 389 in the case-finding strategy group and 440 in the usual care group. More patients in the case-finding group received a new diagnosis of HF or COPD than the usual care group (cumulative incidence 34\% vs 2\% and 17\% vs. 2\%, respectively). Scores for health status, functionality, and health care use were similar between the 2 strategies after 6 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A case-finding strategy applied in primary care to multimorbid older people with dyspnea or reduced exercise tolerance resulted in a number of new diagnoses of HF and COPD but did not result in short-term improvement of health status compared to usual care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) pose specific challenges in rare and heterogeneous neurological diseases due to the small numbers of patients and heterogeneity in disease course. Two analytical approaches have been proposed to optimally handle these issues in RCTs: covariate adjustment and ordinal analysis. We investigated the potential gain in efficiency of these approaches in rare and heterogeneous neurological diseases, using Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) as an example. METHODS: We analyzed two published GBS trials with primary outcome 'at least one grade improvement' on the GBS disability scale. We estimated the treatment effect using logistic regression models with and without adjustment for prognostic factors. The difference between the unadjusted and adjusted estimates was disentangled in imbalance (random differences in baseline covariates between treatment arms) and stratification (change of the estimate due to covariate adjustment). Second, we applied proportional odds regression, which exploits the ordinal nature of the GBS disability score. The standard error of the estimated treatment effect indicated the statistical efficiency. RESULTS: Both trials were slightly imbalanced with respect to baseline characteristics, which was corrected in the adjusted analysis. Covariate adjustment increased the estimated treatment effect in the two trials by 8\% and 18\% respectively. Proportional odds analysis resulted in lower standard errors indicating more statistical power. CONCLUSION: Covariate adjustment and proportional odds analysis most efficiently use the available data and ensure balance between the treatment arms to obtain reliable and valid treatment effect estimates. These approaches merit application in future trials in rare and heterogeneous neurological diseases like GBS.},

If the effect of measurement error is misjudged, the data analyses are hampered and the validity of the studyâs inferences may be affected. In this paper, we describe five myths that contribute to misjudgments about measurement error, regarding expected structure, impact and solutions to mitigate the problems resulting from mismeasurements. The aim is to clarify these measurement error misconceptions. We show that the influence of measurement error in an epidemiological data analysis can play out in ways that go beyond simple heuristics, such as heuristics about whether or not to expect attenuation of the effect estimates. Whereas we encourage epidemiologists to deliberate about the structure and potential impact of measurement error in their analyses, we also recommend exercising restraint when making claims about the magnitude or even direction of effect of measurement error if not accompanied by statistical measurement error corrections or quantitative bias analysis. Suggestions for alleviating the problems or investigating the structure and magnitude of measurement error are given.},

Indeed, for nonlinear monotonic associations alternative measures like Spearmanâs rank and Kendallâs tau correlation coefficients are considered more appropriate. These views or opinions on the estimation of association are strongly rooted in the statistical and other empirical sciences. After defining linear and monotonic associations, we will demonstrate that these opinions are incorrect. Pearsonâs correlation coefficient should not be ruled out a priori for measuring nonlinear monotonic associations. We will provide examples of practically relevant families of bivariate distribution functions with nonlinear monotonic associations for which Pearsonâs correlation is preferred over Spearmanâs rank and Kendallâs tau correlation in testing the dependency between X and Y. Alternatively, we will provide a family of bivariate distributions with a linear association between X and Y for which Spearmanâs rank and Kendallâs tau are preferred over Pearsonâs correlation.

In this review, we argue that regression discontinuity is underutilized in healthcare research despite the ubiquity of threshold based decision making as well as the designâs simplicity and transparency. Moreover, regression discontinuity provides evidence of âreal worldâ therapeutic and policy effects, circumventing a major limitation of randomized controlled trials.

  abstract = {Most Bayesian response-adaptive designs unbalance randomization rates toward the most promising arms with the goal of increasing the number of positive treatment outcomes during the study, even though the primary aim of the trial is different. We discuss Bayesian uncertainty directed designs (BUD), a class of Bayesian designs in which the investigator specifies an information measure tailored to the experiment. All decisions during the trial are selected to optimize the available information at the end of the study. The approach can be applied to several designs, ranging from early stage multi-arm trials to biomarker-driven and multi-endpoint studies. We discuss the asymptotic limit of the patient allocation proportion to treatments, and illustrate the finite-sample operating characteristics of BUD designs through examples, including multi-arm trials, biomarker-stratified trials, and trials with multiple co-primary endpoints.

  abstract = {The Mann-Whitney U test is frequently used to evaluate treatment effects in randomized experiments with skewed outcome distributions or small sample sizes. It may lack power, however, because it ignores the auxiliary baseline covariate information that is routinely collected. Wald and score tests in so-called probabilistic index models generalize the Mann-Whitney U test to enable adjustment for covariates, but these may lack robustness by demanding correct model specification and do not lend themselves to small sample inference. Using semiparametric efficiency theory, we here propose an alternative extension of the Mann-Whitney U test, which increases its power by exploiting covariate information in an objective way and which lends itself to permutation inference. Simulation studies and an application to an HIV clinical trial show that the proposed permutation test attains the nominal Type I error rate and can be drastically more powerful than the classical Mann-Whitney U test.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Many randomized trials involve measuring a continuous outcome - such as pain, body weight or blood pressure - at baseline and after treatment. In this paper, I compare four possibilities for how such trials can be analyzed: post-treatment; change between baseline and post-treatment; percentage change between baseline and post-treatment and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline score as a covariate. The statistical power of each method was determined for a hypothetical randomized trial under a range of correlations between baseline and post-treatment scores.RESULTS:ANCOVA has the highest statistical power. Change from baseline has acceptable power when correlation between baseline and post-treatment scores is high;when correlation is low, analyzing only post-treatment scores has reasonable power. Percentage change from baseline has the lowest statistical power and was highly sensitive to changes in variance. Theoretical considerations suggest that percentage change from baseline will also fail to protect from bias in the case of baseline imbalance and will lead to an excess of trials with non-normally distributed outcome data.CONCLUSIONS:Percentage change from baseline should not be used in statistical analysis. Trialists wishing to report this statistic should use another method, such as ANCOVA, and convert the results to a percentage change by using mean baseline scores.},

  abstract = {Background The average treatment effect of antidepressants in major depression was found to be about 2 points on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, which lies below clinical relevance. Here, we searched for evidence of a relevant treatment effect heterogeneity that could justify the usage of antidepressants despite their low average treatment effect. Methods Bayesian meta-analysis of 169 randomized, controlled trials including 58,687 patients. We considered the effect sizes log variability ratio (lnVR) and log coefficient of variation ratio (lnCVR) to analyze the difference in variability of active and placebo response. We used Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses (REMA) for lnVR and lnCVR and fitted a random-effects meta-regression (REMR) model to estimate the treatment effect variability between antidepressants and placebo. Results The variability ratio was found to be very close to 1 in the best fitting models (REMR: 95\% highest density interval (HDI) [0.98, 1.02], REMA: 95\% HDI [1.00, 1.02]). The between-study standard deviation Ï under the REMA with respect to lnVR was found to be low (95\% HDI [0.00, 0.02]). Simulations showed that a large treatment effect heterogeneity is only compatible with the data if a strong correlation between placebo response and individual treatment effect is assumed. Conclusions The published data from RCTs on antidepressants for the treatment of major depression is compatible with a near-constant treatment effect. Although it is impossible to rule out a substantial treatment effect heterogeneity, its existence seems rather unlikely. Since the average treatment effect of antidepressants falls short of clinical relevance, the current prescribing practice should be re-evaluated.},

  abstract = {Statistical models are often fitted to obtain a concise description of the association of an outcome variable with some covariates. Even if background knowledge is available to guide preselection of covariates, stepwise variable selection is commonly applied to remove irrelevant ones. This practice may introduce additional variability and selection is rarely certain. However, these issues are often ignored and model stability is not questioned. Several resampling-based measures were proposed to describe model stability, including variable inclusion frequencies (VIFs), model selection frequencies, relative conditional bias (RCB), and root mean squared difference ratio (RMSDR). The latter two were recently proposed to assess bias and variance inflation induced by variable selection. Here, we study the consistency and accuracy of resampling estimates of these measures and the optimal choice of the resampling technique. In particular, we compare subsampling and bootstrapping for assessing stability of linear, logistic, and Cox models obtained by backward elimination in a simulation study. Moreover, we exemplify the estimation and interpretation of all suggested measures in a study on cardiovascular risk. The VIF and the model selection frequency are only consistently estimated in the subsampling approach. By contrast, the bootstrap is advantageous in terms of bias and precision for estimating the RCB as well as the RMSDR. Though, unbiased estimation of the latter quantity requires independence of covariates, which is rarely encountered in practice. Our study stresses the importance of addressing model stability after variable selection and shows how to cope with it.},

Our general theoretical framework includes ordinary least squares, generalized linear models, quantile regression, and many others as special cases. Specifically, LSA can transfer many different types of LASSO objective functions into their asymptotically equivalent least squares problems. Thereafter, the standard asymptotic theory can be established and the LARS algorithm can be applied. In particular, if the adaptive LASSO penalty and a Bayes information criterionâtype tuning parameter selector are used, the resulting LSA estimator can be as efficient as the oracle.

  abstract = {âCovariate adjustment' in the randomized trial context refers to an estimator of the average treatment effect that adjusts for chance imbalances between study arms in baseline variables (called âcovariates'). The baseline variables could include, e.g., age, sex, disease severity, and biomarkers. According to two surveys of clinical trial reports, there is confusion about the statistical properties of covariate adjustment. We focus on the ANCOVA estimator, which involves fitting a linear model for the outcome given the treatment arm and baseline variables, and trials that use simple randomization with equal probability of assignment to treatment and control. We prove the following new (to the best of our knowledge) robustness property of ANCOVA to arbitrary model misspecification: Not only is the ANCOVA point estimate consistent (as proved by Yang and Tsiatis (2001)) but so is its standard error.

  abstract = {âCovariate adjustmentâ in the randomized trial context refers to an estimator of the average treatment effect that adjusts for chance imbalances between study arms in baseline variables (called âcovariatesâ). The baseline variables could include, for example, age, sex, disease severity, and biomarkers. According to two surveys of clinical trial reports, there is confusion about the statistical properties of covariate adjustment. We focus on the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) estimator, which involves fitting a linear model for the outcome given the treatment arm and baseline variables, and trials that use simple randomization with equal probability of assignment to treatment and control. We prove the following new (to the best of our knowledge) robustness property of ANCOVA to arbitrary model misspecification: Not only is the ANCOVA point estimate consistent (as proved by Yang and Tsiatis, 2001) but so is its standard error. This implies that confidence intervals and hypothesis tests conducted as if the linear model were correct are still asymptotically valid even when the linear model is arbitrarily misspecified, for example, when the baseline variables are nonlinearly related to the outcome or there is treatment effect heterogeneity. We also give a simple, robust formula for the variance reduction (equivalently, sample size reduction) from using ANCOVA.

However, whether matched-pairs analyses should be used as a primary approach is still in debate. We compared the statistical power and type 1 error rate for four commonly used methods of analyzing propensity-scoreâmatched samples with continuous outcomes: (1) an unadjusted mixed-effects model, (2) an unadjusted generalized estimating method, (3) simple linear regression, and (4) multiple linear regression. Multiple linear regression had the highest statistical power among the four competing methods. We also found that the degree of intraclass correlation within matched pairs depends on the dissimilarity between the coefficient vectors of confounders in the outcome and treatment models. Multiple linear regression is superior to the unadjusted matched-pairs analyses for propensity-scoreâmatched data.},

This paper discusses key results of the investigation and development and their practical implication on pharmaceutical statistics.

  abstract = {We introduce a simple new approach to variable selection in linear regression, with a particular focus on quantifying uncertainty in which variables should be selected. The approach is based on a new modelâthe âsum of single effectsâ model, called âSuSiEââwhich comes from writing the sparse vector of regression coefficients as a sum of âsingle-effectâ vectors, each with one non-zero element. We also introduce a corresponding new fitting procedureâiterative Bayesian stepwise selection (IBSS)âwhich is a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods. IBSS shares the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise methods but, instead of selecting a single variable at each step, IBSS computes a distribution on variables that captures uncertainty in which variable to select. We provide a formal justification of this intuitive algorithm by showing that it optimizes a variational approximation to the posterior distribution under SuSiE. Further, this approximate posterior distribution naturally yields convenient novel summaries of uncertainty in variable selection, providing a credible set of variables for each selection. Our methods are particularly well suited to settings where variables are highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse, both of which are characteristics of genetic fine mapping applications. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our methods outperform existing methods for this task, and we illustrate their application to fine mapping genetic variants influencing alternative splicing in human cell lines. We also discuss the potential and challenges for applying these methods to generic variable-selection problems.},

  abstract = {Sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) are systematic and efficient media for comparing dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs), where each patient is involved in multiple stages of treatment with the randomization at each stage depending on the patientâs previous treatment history and interim outcomes. Generally, patients enrolled in SMARTs are randomized equally to ethically acceptable treatment options regardless of how effective those treatments were during the previous stages, which results in some undesirable consequences in practice, such as low recruitment, less retention, and lower treatment adherence. In this article, we propose a response-adaptive SMART (RA-SMART) design where the allocation probabilities are imbalanced in favor of more promising treatments based on the accumulated information on treatment efficacy from previous patients and stages. The operating characteristics of the RA-SMART design relative to SMART design, including the consistency and efficiency of estimated response rate under each DTR, the power of identifying the optimal DTR, and the number of patients treated with the optimal and the worst DTRs, are assessed through extensive simulation studies. Some practical suggestions are discussed in the conclusion.},

  abstract = {The incidence and longitudinal trends of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presenting to United States (US) emergency departments (EDs) are currently unknown. Efforts to use effective treatments for cardiovascular disease may decrease ED STEMI presentation. We conducted a descriptive epidemiological analysis of STEMI visits to EDs from 2006 to 2011 using the Nationwide ED Sample, the largest source of US ED data, to determine the incidence of patients with STEMIs presenting to the US EDs. We included adult ED visits with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis of STEMI and calculated incidence rates for STEMI ED visits using US census population data. Incidence calculations were stratified by age group, geographic region, and year. From 2006 to 2011, there was a mean of 258,106 STEMIs presenting to EDs per year, decreasing from 300,466 in 2006 to 227,343 in 2011. Incidence of ED STEMI visits per 10,000 adults decreased from 10.1 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 9.8 to 10.8) in 2006 to 7.3 (95\% CI 6.8 to 7.8) in 2011. The Midwest had the highest rate of ED STEMIs at 10.0 (95\% CI 9.2 to 10.8) and the West had the lowest with 6.6 (95\% CI 6.1 to 7.0). The incidence of STEMI decreased for all age groups during the study period. In conclusion, we report the first national estimates of STEMI presentation to US EDs, which demonstrate decreasing incidence across all age groups and all geographic regions from 2006 to 2011. A decreasing STEMI incidence may affect the quality and timeliness of STEMI care. Continued national STEMI surveillance is needed to guide healthcare resource allocation.

Our objective was to determine whether insurance status is a predictor of interfacility transfer for emergency department visits with STEMI. We analyzed data from the 2006 to 2011 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample examining all emergency department visits for patients age 18~years and older with a diagnosis of STEMI and a disposition of interfacility transfer or hospitalization at the same institution. For emergency department visits with STEMI, our multivariate logistic regression model included emergency department disposition status (interfacility transfer vs hospitalization at the same institution) as the primary outcome, and insurance status (none vs any [including Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance]) as the primary exposure. We found that among 1,377,827 emergency department STEMI visits, including 249,294 (18.1\%) transfers, patients without health insurance (adjusted odds ratio 1.6, 95\% CI 1.5 to 1.7) were more likely to be transferred than those with insurance.

Lord Kelvin (who was addressing physicists, not physicians), had been quoted as saying in effect, that if your knowledge could not be expressed in numbers, then it was of a meager and unsatisfactory kind. Health care, because of its desire to be `scientific,' has not only been stricken by the curse of Kelvin, but has positively embraced it; this despite the fact that many prominent scientists (including some of Kelvin's contemporaries, eg, Darwin or Virchow) succeeded while completely ignoring his advice. Thus, we see a proliferation of scales and measurement instruments aimed at quantifying the hitherto unquantifiable". A.R.

  abstract = {A common challenge for the development of drugs in rare diseases and special populations, eg, paediatrics, is the small numbers of patients that can be recruited into clinical trials. Extrapolation can be used to support development and licensing in paediatrics through the structured integration of available data in adults and prospectively generated data in paediatrics to derive conclusions that support licensing decisions in the target paediatric population. In this context, Bayesian analyses have been proposed to obtain formal proof of efficacy of a new drug or therapeutic principle by using additional information (data, opinion, or expectation), expressed through a prior distribution. However, little is said about the impact of the prior assumptions on the evaluation of outcome and prespecified strategies for decision-making as required in the regulatory context. On the basis of examples, we explore the use of data-based Bayesian meta-analyticâpredictive methods and compare these approaches with common frequentist and Bayesian meta-analysis models. Noninformative efficacy prior distributions usually do not change the conclusions irrespective of the chosen analysis method. However, if heterogeneity is considered, conclusions are highly dependent on the heterogeneity prior. When using informative efficacy priors based on previous study data in combination with heterogeneity priors, these may completely determine conclusions irrespective of the data generated in the target population. Thus, it is important to understand the impact of the prior assumptions and ensure that prospective trial data in the target population have an appropriate chance, to change prior belief to avoid trivial and potentially erroneous conclusions.},

  abstract = {Often in medical studies of time to an event, the treatment effect is not constant over time. In the context of Cox regression modeling, the most frequent solution is to apply a model that assumes the treatment effect is either piecewise constant or varies smoothly over time, i.e., the Cox nonproportional hazards model. This approach has at least two major limitations. First, it is generally difficult to assess whether the parametric form chosen for the treatment effect is correct. Second, in the presence of nonproportional hazards, investigators are usually more interested in the cumulative than the instantaneous treatment effect (e.g., determining if and when the survival functions cross). Therefore, we propose an estimator for the aggregate treatment effect in the presence of nonproportional hazards. Our estimator is based on the treatment-specific baseline cumulative hazards estimated under a stratified Cox model. No functional form for the nonproportionality need be assumed. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are derived, and the finite-sample properties are assessed in simulation studies. Pointwise and simultaneous confidence bands of the estimator can be computed. The proposed method is applied to data from a national organ failure registry.},

  abstract = {Recurrent events are commonly encountered in longitudinal studies. The observation of recurrent events is often stopped by a dependent terminal event in practice. For this data scenario, we propose two sensible adaptations of the generalized accelerated recurrence time (GART) model (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 111 (2016) 145â156) to provide useful alternative analyses that can offer physical interpretations while rendering extra flexibility beyond the existing work based on the accelerated failure time model. Our modeling strategies align with the rationale underlying the use of the survivorsâ rate function or the adjusted rate function to account for the presence of the dependent terminal event. For the proposed models, we identify and develop estimation and inference procedures which can be readily implemented based on existing software. We establish the asymptotic properties of the new estimator. Simulation studies demonstrate good finite-sample performance of the proposed methods. An application to a dataset from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) illustrates the practical utility of the new methods.},

In Stage 1, all patients are randomized to one of three treatments. In Stage 2, patients who respond to their initial treatment receive the same treatment again, while those who fail to respond are re-randomized to one of the two remaining treatments. A Bayesian method for estimating the response rate of each individual treatment in a three-arm snSMART demonstrated efficiency gains for a given sample size relative to other existing frequentist approaches. However, these efficiency gains are dependent upon knowing how many subjects are required to determine a specific difference in the treatment response rates. Because few sample size calculation methods for snSMARTs exist, we propose a Bayesian sample size calculation for an snSMART designed to distinguish the best treatment from the second-best treatment. Although our methods are based on asymptotic approximations, we demonstrate via simulations that our proposed sample size calculation approach produces the desired statistical power, even in small samples. Moreover, our methods and applet produce sample sizes quickly, thereby saving time relative to using simulations to determine the appropriate sample size. We compare our proposed sample size to an existing frequentist method based upon a weighted Z -statistic and demonstrate that the Bayesian method requires far fewer patients than the frequentist method for a study with the same design parameters.},

  abstract = {Biostatistics---the application of statistics to understanding health and biologyâprovides powerful tools for developing research questions, designing studies, refining measurements, analyzing data, and interpreting findings. Biostatistics plays an important role in health-related research, yet biostatistics resources are often fragmented, ad hoc, or oversubscribed within academic health centers (AHCs). Given the increasing complexity and quantity of health-related data, the emphasis on accelerating clinical and translational science, and the importance of conducting reproducible research, the need for the thoughtful development of biostatistics resources within AHCs is growing. In this article, the authors identify strategies for developing biostatistics resources in three areas: (1) recruiting and retaining biostatisticians, (2) efficiently using biostatistics resources, and (3) improving biostatistical contributions to science. AHCs should consider these three domains in building strong biostatistics resources, which they can leverage to support a broad spectrum of research. For each of the three domains, the authors describe the advantages and disadvantages of AHCs creating centralized biostatistics units rather than dispersing such resources across clinical departments or other research units. They also address the challenges that biostatisticians face in contributing to research without sacrificing their individual professional growth or the trajectory of their research teams. The authors ultimately recommend that AHCs create centralized biostatistics units because this approach offers distinct advantages both to investigators who collaborate with biostatisticians as well as to the biostatisticians themselves, and it is better suited to accomplish the research and education missions of AHCs.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in using routinely collected data from health care databases to study the safety and effectiveness of therapies in â realâworldâ conditions, as it can provide complementary evidence to that of randomized controlled trials. Causal inference from health care databases is challenging because the data are typically noisy, high dimensional, and most importantly, observational. It requires methods that can estimate heterogeneous treatment effects while controlling for confounding in high dimensions. Bayesian additive regression trees, causal forests, causal boosting, and causal multivariate adaptive regression splines are offâtheâshelf methods that have shown good performance for estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in observational studies of continuous outcomes. However, it is not clear how these methods would perform in health care database studies where outcomes are often binary and rare and data structures are complex. In this study, we evaluate these methods in simulation studies that recapitulate key characteristics of comparative effectiveness studies. We focus on the conditional average effect of a binary treatment on a binary outcome using the conditional risk difference as an estimand. To emulate health care database studies, we propose a simulation design where real covariate and treatment assignment data are used and only outcomes are simulated based on nonparametric models of the real outcomes. We apply this design to 4 published observational studies that used records from 2 major health care databases in the United States. Our results suggest that Bayesian additive regression trees and causal boosting consistently provide low bias in conditional risk difference estimates in the context of health care database studies.},

The specification of a population-averaged GEE model includes selection of a structure describing the correlation of repeated measures. Accurate specification of this structure can improve efficiency, whereas the finite-sample estimation of nuisance correlation parameters can inflate the variances of regression parameter estimates. Therefore, correlation structure selection criteria should penalize, or account for, correlation parameter estimation.

  abstract = {Recent concerns about a shortage of capacity for statistical and numerical analysis skills among social science students and researchers have prompted a range of initiatives aiming to improve teaching in this area. However, these projects have rarely re-evaluated the content of what is taught to students and have instead focussed primarily on delivery. The emphasis has generally been on increased use of complex techniques, specialist software and, most importantly in the context of this paper, a continued focus on inferential statistical tests, often at the expense of other types of analysis. We argue that this "business as usual" approach to the content of statistics teaching is problematic for several reasons. First, the assumptions underlying inferential statistical tests are rarely met, meaning that students are being taught analyses that should only be used very rarely. Secondly, all of the most common outputs of inferential statistical tests--p-values, standard errors and confidence intervals--suffer from a similar logical problem that renders them at best useless and at worst misleading. Eliminating inferential statistical tests from statistics teaching (and practice) would avoid the creation of another generation of researchers who either do not understand, or knowingly misuse, these techniques. It would also have the benefit of removing one of the key barriers to students' understanding of statistical analysis.

  abstract = {Bayesian methods allow borrowing of historical information through prior distributions. The concept of prior effective sample size (prior ESS) facilitates quantification and communication of such prior information by equating it to a sample size. Prior information can arise from historical observations, thus the traditional approach identifies the ESS with such historical sample size. However, this measure is independent from newly observed data, and thus would not capture an actual âloss of informationâ induced by the prior in case of prior-data conflict. We build on recent work to relate prior impact to a number of (virtual) samples from the current data model and introduce the effective current sample size (ECSS) of a prior, tailored to the application in Bayesian clinical trial designs. Special emphasis is put on robust mixture, power and commensurate priors. We apply the approach to an adaptive design in which the number of recruited patients is adjusted depending on the effective sample size at an interim analysis. We argue that the ECSS is the appropriate measure in this case, as the aim is to save current (as opposed to historical) patients from recruitment. Furthermore, the ECSS can help overcoming lack of consensus in the ESS assessment of mixture priors and can, more broadly, provide further insights into the impact of priors.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Substantial morbidity and excessive care variation are seen with pediatric pneumonia. Accurate risk-stratification tools to guide clinical decision-making are needed. METHODS: We developed risk models to predict severe pneumonia outcomes in children ({$<$}18 years) by using data from the Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community Study, a prospective study of community-acquired pneumonia hospitalizations conducted in 3 US cities from January 2010 to June 2012. In-hospital outcomes were organized into an ordinal severity scale encompassing severe (mechanical ventilation, shock, or death), moderate (intensive care admission only), and mild (non-intensive care hospitalization) outcomes. Twenty predictors, including patient, laboratory, and radiographic characteristics at presentation, were evaluated in 3 models: a full model included all 20 predictors, a reduced model included 10 predictors based on expert consensus, and an electronic health record (EHR) model included 9 predictors typically available as structured data within comprehensive EHRs. Ordinal regression was used for model development. Predictive accuracy was estimated by using discrimination (concordance index). RESULTS: Among the 2319 included children, 21\% had a moderate or severe outcome (14\% moderate, 7\% severe). Each of the models accurately identified risk for moderate or severe pneumonia (concordance index across models 0.78-0.81). Age, vital signs, chest indrawing, and radiologic infiltrate pattern were the strongest predictors of severity. The reduced and EHR models retained most of the strongest predictors and performed as well as the full model. CONCLUSIONS: We created 3 risk models that accurately estimate risk for severe pneumonia in children. Their use holds the potential to improve care and outcomes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the health utility states of the most commonly used traumatic brain injury (TBI) clinical trial endpoint, the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Health utilities represent the strength of one's preferences under conditions of uncertainty. There are insufficient data to indicate how an individual would value levels of disability after a TBI. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional web-based online convenience sampling adaptive survey. Using a standard gamble approach, participants evaluated their preferences for GOSE health states 1 year after a hypothetical TBI. The categorical GOSE was studied from vegetative state (GOSE2) to upper good recovery (GOSE8). Median (25th percentile, 75th percentile) health utility values for different GOSE states after TBI, ranging from -1 (worse than death) to 1 (full health), with 0 as reference (death). RESULTS: Of 3508 eligible participants, 3235 (92.22\%) completed the survey. Participants rated lower GOSE states as having lower utility, with some states rated as worse than death, though the relationship was nonlinear and intervals were unequal between health states. Over 75\% of participants rated a vegetative state (GOSE2, absence of awareness and bedridden) and about 50\% rated lower severe disability (GOSE3, housebound needing all-day assistance) as conditions worse than death. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest investigation of public perceptions about post-TBI disability, we demonstrate unequally rated health states, with some states perceived as worse than death. Although limited by selection bias, these results may guide future comparative-effectiveness research and shared medical decision-making after neurologic injury.},

  abstract = {Nonparametric regression models have recently surged in their power and popularity, accompanying the trend of increasing dataset size and complexity. While these models have proven their predictive ability in empirical settings, they are often difficult to interpret and do not address the underlying inferential goals of the analyst or decision maker. In this article, we propose a modular two-stage approach for creating parsimonious, interpretable summaries of complex models which allow freedom in the choice of modeling technique and the inferential target. In the first stage, a flexible model is fit which is believed to be as accurate as possible. In the second stage, lower-dimensional summaries are constructed by projecting draws from the distribution onto simpler structures. These summaries naturally come with valid Bayesian uncertainty estimates. Further, since we use the data only once to move from prior to posterior, these uncertainty estimates remain valid across multiple summaries and after iteratively refining a summary. We apply our method and demonstrate its strengths across a range of simulated and real datasets. The methods we present here are implemented in an R package available at github.com/spencerwoody/possum. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {In developing products for rare diseases, statistical challenges arise due to the limited number of patients available for participation in drug trials and other clinical research. Bayesian adaptive clinical trial designs offer the possibility of increased statistical efficiency, reduced development cost and ethical hazard prevention via their incorporation of evidence from external sources (historical data, expert opinions, and real-world evidence), and flexibility in the specification of interim looks. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian adaptive commensurate design that borrows adaptively from historical information and also uses a particular payoff function to optimize the timing of the study's interim analysis. The trial payoff is a function of how many samples can be saved via early stopping and the probability of making correct early decisions for either futility or efficacy. We calibrate our Bayesian algorithm to have acceptable long-run frequentist properties (Type I error and power) via simulation at the design stage. We illustrate our approach using a pediatric trial design setting testing the effect of a new drug for a rare genetic disease. The optimIA R package available at https://github.com/wxwx1993/Bayesian\_IA\_Timing provides an easy-to-use implementation of our approach.},

  abstract = {Regularization techniques such as the lasso (Tibshirani 1996) and elastic net (Zou and Hastie 2005) can be used to improve regression model coefficient estimation and prediction accuracy, as well as to perform variable selection. Ordinal regression models are widely used in applications where the use of regularization could be beneficial; however, these models are not included in many popular software packages for regularized regression. We propose a coordinate descent algorithm to fit a broad class of ordinal regression models with an elastic net penalty. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each model in this class generalizes to a more flexible form, that can be used to model either ordered or unordered categorical response data. We call this the elementwise link multinomial-ordinal class, and it includes widely used models such as multinomial logistic regression (which also has an ordinal form) and ordinal logistic regression (which also has an unordered multinomial form). We introduce an elastic net penalty class that applies to either model form, and additionally, this penalty can be used to shrink a non-ordinal model toward its ordinal counterpart. Finally, we introduce the R package ordinalNet, which implements the algorithm for this model class.},

  abstract = {Few methods are currently available for group sequential analysis of recurrent events data subject to a terminal event in the clinical trial setting. This research helps fill this gap by developing a completely nonparametric group sequential monitoring procedure for use with the two-sample Tayob and Murray statistic. Advantages of the Tayob and Murray statistic include high power to detect treatment differences when there is correlation between recurrent event times or between recurrent and terminal events in an individual. This statistic does not suffer bias from dependent censoring, regardless of the correlation between event times in an individual. This manuscript briefly reviews the Tayob and Murray statistic, develops and describes how to use methods for its group sequential analysis, and through simulation, compares its operating characteristics with those of Cook and Lawless, which is currently in use as the only available nonparametric method for group sequential analysis of recurrent event data. The merits of our proposed approach are most clearly demonstrated when gap times between recurrent events are correlated; when gap times between events are independent, the Cook and Lawless method is difficult to beat. Simulations demonstrate that as correlation between recurrent event times grows, the reduction in power using the Cook and Lawless approach is substantial when compared to our method. Finally, we use our method to analyze recurrent acute exacerbation outcomes from the azithromycin in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease trial.},

  abstract = {A subset of colorectal cancers was postulated to have the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), a higher propensity for CpG island DNA methylation. The validity of CIMP, its molecular basis, and its prognostic value remain highly controversial. Using MBD-isolated genome sequencing, we mapped and compared genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of normal, non-CIMP, and CIMP colon specimens. Multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that each specimen could be clearly classified as normal, non-CIMP, and CIMP, thus signifying that these three groups have distinctly different global methylation patterns. We discovered 3780 sites in various genomic contexts that were hypermethylated in both non-CIMP and CIMP colon cancers when compared with normal colon. An additional 2026 sites were found to be hypermethylated in CIMP tumors only; and importantly, 80\% of these sites were located in CpG islands. These data demonstrate on a genome-wide level that the additional hypermethylation seen in CIMP tumors occurs almost exclusively at CpG islands and support definitively that these tumors were appropriately named. When these sites were examined more closely, we found that 25\% were adjacent to sites that were also hypermethylated in non-CIMP tumors. Thus, CIMP is also characterized by more extensive methylation of sites that are already prone to be hypermethylated in colon cancer. These observations indicate that CIMP tumors have specific defects in controlling both DNA methylation seeding and spreading and serve as an important first step in delineating molecular mechanisms that control these processes.},

  abstract = {Large-scale cancer genomic studies, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have profiled multidimensional genomic data, including mutation and expression profiles on a variety of cancer cell types, to uncover the molecular mechanism of cancerogenesis. More than a hundred driver mutations have been characterized that confer the advantage of cell growth. However, how driver mutations regulate the transcriptome to affect cellular functions remains largely unexplored. Differential analysis of gene expression relative to a driver mutation on patient samples could provide us with new insights in understanding driver mutation dysregulation in tumor genome and developing personalized treatment strategies. Here, we introduce the Snowball approach as a highly sensitive statistical analysis method to identify transcriptional signatures that are affected by a recurrent driver mutation. Snowball utilizes a resampling-based approach and combines a distance-based regression framework to assign a robust ranking index of genes based on their aggregated association with the presence of the mutation, and further selects the top significant genes for downstream data analyses or experiments. In our application of the Snowball approach to both synthesized and TCGA data, we demonstrated that it outperforms the standard methods and provides more accurate inferences to the functional effects and transcriptional dysregulation of driver mutations.

  abstract = {Multiple imputation is a promising approach to handle missing data and is widely used in analysis of longitudinal clinical studies. A key consideration in the implementation of multiple imputation is to obtain accurate imputed values by specifying an imputation model that incorporates auxiliary variables potentially associated with missing variables. The use of informative auxiliary variables is known to be beneficial to make the missing at random assumption more plausible and help to reduce uncertainty of the imputations; however, it is not straightforward to pre-specify them in many cases. We propose a data-driven specification of the imputation model using Bayesian lasso in the context of longitudinal clinical study, and develop a built-in function of the Bayesian lasso imputation model which is performed within the framework of multiple imputation using chained equations. A simulation study suggested that the Bayesian lasso imputation model worked well in a variety of longitudinal study settings, providing unbiased treatment effect estimates with well-controlled type I error rates and coverage probabilities of the confidence interval; in contrast, ignorance of the informative auxiliary variables led to serious bias and inflation of type I error rate. Moreover, the Bayesian lasso imputation model offered higher statistical powers compared with conventional imputation methods. In our simulation study, the gains in statistical power were remarkable when the sample size was small relative to the number of auxiliary variables. An illustration through a real example also suggested that the Bayesian lasso imputation model could give smaller standard errors of the treatment effect estimate.},

We show that 45\% of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date.},

  abstract = {Multivariate discrete outcomes are common in a wide range of areas including insurance, finance, and biology. When the interplay between outcomes is significant, quantifying dependencies among interrelated variables is of great importance. Due to their ability to accommodate dependence flexibly, copulas are being applied increasingly. Yet, the application of copulas on discrete data is still in its infancy; one of the biggest barriers is the nonuniqueness of copulas, calling into question model interpretations and predictions. In this article, we study copula estimation with discrete outcomes in a regression context. As the marginal distributions vary with covariates, inclusion of continuous regressors expands the region of support for consistent estimation of copulas. Because some properties of continuous outcomes do not carry over to discrete outcomes, specification of a copula model has been a problem. We propose a nonparametric estimator of copulas to identify the âhiddenâ dependence structure for discrete outcomes and develop its asymptotic properties. The proposed nonparametric estimator can also serve as a diagnostic tool for selecting a parametric form for copulas. In the simulation study, we explore the performance of the proposed estimator under different scenarios and provide guidance on when the choice of copulas is important. The performance of the estimator improves as discreteness diminishes. A practical bandwidth selector is also proposed. An empirical analysis examines a dataset from the Local Government Property Insurance Fund (LGPIF) in the state of Wisconsin. We apply the nonparametric estimator to model the dependence among claim frequencies from different types of insurance coverage. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {For semi-competing risks data involving a non-terminal event and a terminal event we derive the asymptotic distributions of the event-specific win ratios under proportional hazards (PH) assumptions for the relevant cause-specific hazard functions of the non-terminal and terminal event, respectively. The win ratios converge to the respective hazard ratios under the PH assumptions and therefore are censoring-free, whether or not the censoring distributions in the two treatment arms are the same. With the asymptotic bivariate normal distributions of the win ratios, confidence intervals and testing procedures are obtained. Through extensive simulation studies and data analysis, we identified proper transformations of the win ratios that yield good control of the type one error rate for various testing procedures while maintaining competitive power. The confidence intervals also have good coverage probabilities. Furthermore, a test for the PH assumptions and a test of equal hazard ratios are developed. The new procedures are illustrated in the clinical trial Aldosterone Antagonist Therapy for Adults With Heart Failure and Preserved Systolic Function, which evaluated the effects of spironolactone in patients with heart failure and a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.},

  abstract = {It is well recognized that cancer drug development for children and adolescents has many challenges, from biological and societal to economic. Pediatric cancer consists of a diverse group of rare diseases, and the relatively small population of children with multiple, disparate tumor types across various age groups presents a significant challenge for drug development programs as compared to oncology drug development programs for adults. Due to the different types of cancers, limited opportunities exist for extrapolation of efficacy from adult cancer indications to children. Thus, innovative study designs including Bayesian statistical approaches should be considered. A Bayesian approach can be a flexible tool to formally leverage prior knowledge of adult or external controls in pediatric cancer trials. In this article, we provide in a case example of how Bayesian approaches can be used to design, monitor, and analyze pediatric trials. Particularly, Bayesian sequential monitoring can be useful to monitor pediatric trial results as data accumulate. In addition, designing a pediatric trial with both skeptical and enthusiastic priors with Bayesian sequential monitoring can be an efficient mechanism for early trial cessation for both efficacy and futility. The interpretation of efficacy using a Bayesian approach is based on posterior probability and is intuitive and interpretable for patients, parents and prescribers given limited data.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Hospital readmissions within 30\,days are a healthcare quality problem associated with increased costs and poor health outcomes. Identifying interventions to improve patients' successful transition from inpatient to outpatient care is a continued challenge. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-centre pragmatic randomised and controlled clinical trial examining the effectiveness of a discharge follow-up phone call to reduce 30-day inpatient readmissions. Our primary endpoint is inpatient readmission within 30\,days of hospital discharge censored for death analysed with an intention-to-treat approach. Secondary endpoints included observation status readmission within 30\,days, time to readmission, all-cause emergency department revisits within 30\,days, patient satisfaction (measured as mean Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores) and 30-day mortality. Exploratory endpoints include the need for assistance with discharge plan implementation among those randomised to the intervention arm and reached by the study nurse, and the number of call attempts to achieve successful intervention delivery. Consistent with the Learning Healthcare System model for clinical research, timeliness is a critical quality for studies to most effectively inform hospital clinical practice. We are challenged to apply pragmatic design elements in order to maintain a high-quality practicable study providing timely results. This type of prospective pragmatic trial empowers the advancement of hospital-wide evidence-based practice directly affecting patients. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Study results will inform the structure, objective and function of future iterations of the hospital's discharge follow-up phone call programme and be submitted for publication in the literature.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of a follow-up telephone call program as a readmission reduction initiative. RESEARCH DESIGN: Pragmatic randomized controlled real-world effectiveness trial. SUBJECTS: We enrolled and randomized all patients discharged home from a hospital general medicine service to a follow-up telephone call program or usual care discharge. Patients discharged against medical advice were excluded. The intervention was a hospital program, delivering a semistructured follow-up telephone call from a nurse within 3-7 days of discharge, designed to assess understanding and provide education, and assistance to support discharge plan implementation. MEASURES: Our primary endpoint was hospital inpatient readmission within 30 days identified by the electronic health record. Secondary endpoints included observation readmission, emergency department revisit, and mortality within 30 days, and patient experience ratings. RESULTS: All 3054 patients discharged home were enrolled and randomized to the telephone call program (n=1534) or usual care discharge (n=1520). Using a prespecified intention-to-treat analysis, we found no evidence supporting differences in 30-day inpatient readmissions [14.9\% vs. 15.3\%; difference -0.4 (95\% confidence interval, 95\% CI), -2.9 to 2.1; P=0.76], observation readmissions [3.8\% vs. 3.6\%; difference 0.2 (95\% CI, -1.1 to 1.6); P=0.74], emergency department revisits [6.1\% vs. 5.4\%; difference 0.7 (95\% CI, -1.0 to 2.3); P=0.43], or mortality [4.4\% vs. 4.9\%; difference -0.5 (95\% CI, -2.0 to 1.0); P=0.51] between telephone call and usual care groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of an impact on 30-day readmissions or mortality due to the postdischarge telephone call program.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations strongly predict mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). Both cardiac and extracardiac stimuli influence BNP levels, suggesting that BNP might have similar prognostic value in patients without HF. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic value of BNP between patients with and those without HF. METHODS: Using the Vanderbilt University Medical Center electronic health record, 30,487 patients (median age 63 years, 50\% men, 17\% black, 38\% with HF) who had a first plasma BNP measurement between 2002 and 2013, with follow-up through 2015, were studied. The risk for death according to BNP level was quantified using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: BNP levels were lower in patients without HF (median 89 pg/ml; interquartile range: 34 to 238 pg/ml) compared with those with HF (median 388 pg/ml; interquartile range: 150 to 940 pg/ml) (p~{$<$} 0.0001). Over 90,898 person-years of follow-up, 5,903 patients without HF (31\%) and 6,181 patients with HF (53\%) died. In multivariate models including demographic and clinical characteristics, BNP and age were the strongest predictors of death in both patients with and those without HF. In acute care settings and even among outpatients with modestly elevated BNP, the risk for death according to BNP was similar between patients with and those without HF. For instance, a BNP level of 400 pg/ml was associated with a 3-year risk for death of 21\% (95\% confidence interval: 20\% to 23\%) and 19\% (95\% confidence interval: 17\% to 20\%) in patients with and those without HF, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients without HF, plasma BNP level is a stronger predictor of death than traditional risk factors. The risk for death associated with any given BNP level is similar between patients with and those without HF,~particularly in the acute care setting.},

Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of 188 consecutive patients treated with TH in the cardiovascular intensive care unit of an academic tertiary care hospital. Neurologically intact survival was observed in 73/188 (38.8\%) patients at hospital discharge and in 48/162 (29.6\%) patients at a median follow up interval of 3 months. Patients in shock at the time of admission had lower baseline MAP at the initiation of TH (81 versus 87mmHg; p=0.002), but had similar achieved MAP during TH (80.3 versus 83.7mmHg; p=0.11). Shock on admission was associated with poor survival (18\% versus 52\%; p{$<$}0.001). Vasopressor use among all patients was common (84.6\%) and was not associated with increased mortality. A multivariable analysis including age, initial rhythm, time to return of spontaneous circulation, baseline MAP and achieved MAP did not demonstrate a relationship between MAP achieved during TH and poor neurological outcome at hospital discharge (OR 1.28, 95\% CI 0.40-4.06; p=0.87) or at outpatient follow up (OR 1.09, 95\% CI 0.32-3.75; p=0.976). We did not observe a relationship between higher achieved MAP during TH and neurologically intact survival. However, shock at the time of admission was clearly associated with poor outcomes in our study population. These data do not support the use of vasopressors to artificially increase MAP in the absence of shock. There is a need for prospective, randomized trials to further define the optimum blood pressure target during treatment with TH. Copyright  2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Follow-up information was obtained by questionnaires at two and six weeks, six, 12 and 18 months and by a telephone interview at four weeks. One outcome measurement at each follow-up is the patientâs self-report on the perception of low-back pain improvement from the previous survey, recorded as âA lot better,â âA little better,â âAbout the sameâ and âWorse.â Since the patientâs perception of improvement may be influenced by past experience, the outcome is analysed using a transition (first-order Markov) model. Although one could collapse categories to the point that logistic regression analysis with repeated measurements could be used, here we allow for multiple categories by relating transition probabilities to covariates and previous outcomes through a polytomous logistic regression model with Markov structure. This approach allows us to assess not only the effects of treatment assignment and baseline characteristics but also the effects of past outcomes in analysing longitudinal categorical data.},

  abstract = {The win ratio composite endpoint, which organizes the components of the composite hierarchically, is becoming popular in late-stage clinical trials. The method involves comparing data in a pair-wise manner starting with the endpoint highest in priority (eg, cardiovascular death). If the comparison is a tie, the endpoint next highest in priority (eg, hospitalizations for heart failure) is compared, and so on. Its sample size is usually calculated through complex simulations because there does not exist in the literature a simple sample size formula. This article provides a formula that depends on the probability that a randomly selected patient from one group does better than a randomly selected patient from another group, and on the probability of a tie. We compare the published 95\% confidence intervals, which require patient-level data, with that calculated from the formula, requiring only summary-level data, for 17 composite or single win ratio endpoints. The two sets of results are similar. Simulations show the sample size formula performs well. The formula provides important insights. It shows when adding an endpoint to the hierarchy can increase power even if the added endpoint has low power by itself. It provides relevant information to modify an on-going blinded trial if necessary. The formula allows a non-specialist to quickly determine the size of the trial with a win ratio endpoint whose use is expected to increase over time.},

  abstract = {Extensive baseline covariate information is routinely collected on participants in randomized clinical trials, and it is well recognized that a proper covariate-adjusted analysis can improve the efficiency of inference on the treatment effect. However, such covariate adjustment has engendered considerable controversy, as post hoc selection of covariates may involve subjectivity and may lead to biased inference, whereas prior specification of the adjustment may exclude important variables from consideration. Accordingly, how to select covariates objectively to gain maximal efficiency is of broad interest. We propose and study the use of modern variable selection methods for this purpose in the context of a semiparametric framework, under which variable selection in modeling the relationship between outcome and covariates is separated from estimation of the treatment effect, circumventing the potential for selection bias associated with standard analysis of covariance methods. We demonstrate that such objective variable selection techniques combined with this framework can identify key variables and lead to unbiased and efficient inference on the treatment effect. A critical issue in finite samples is validity of estimators of uncertainty, such as standard errors and confidence intervals for the treatment effect. We propose an approach to estimation of sampling variation of estimated treatment effect and show its superior performance relative to that of existing methods.},

Oropharyngeal and distal esophageal reflux parameters were measured for controls (n = 20), patients with GERD (n = 17), and patients with chronic laryngitis (n = 10). In the liquid phase, at pH 4-5, the oropharyngeal probe had less deviation from the target value than the standard catheter; deviation in the vapor phase was similar (0.4 pH units). Median (interquartile) time to reach equilibrium pH was significantly (P {$<$} 0.001) faster with the oropharyngeal than the standard probe. In comparing simultaneous distal esophageal pH characteristics, 96\% of recordings with the new and standard probes were in agreement to within Â± 1.0 pH unit; 71\% of recordings were in agreement within Â± 0.5 pH units. Patients with chronic laryngitis had significantly higher levels of oropharyngeal acid exposure at pH {$<$}4, {$<$}5, and {$<$}6, in the upright position than patients with GERD or controls (P {$<$} .001). Oropharyngeal pH monitoring appears to be more sensitive than traditional pH monitoring in evaluation of patients with extraesophageal reflux. It is a promising tool in evaluation of this difficult group of patients.  2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Most randomized trials are designed and analyzed using frequentist statistical approaches such as null hypothesis testing and P values. Conceptually, P values are cumbersome to understand, as they provide evidence of data incompatibility with a null hypothesis (e.g., no clinical benefit) and not direct evidence of the alternative hypothesis (e.g., clinical benefit). This counterintuitive framework may contribute to the misinterpretation that the absence of evidence is equal to evidence of absence and may cause the discounting of potentially informative data. Bayesian methods provide an alternative, probabilistic interpretation of data. The reanalysis of completed trials using Bayesian methods is becoming increasingly common, particularly for trials with effect estimates that appear clinically significant despite P values above the traditional threshold of 0.05. Statistical inference using Bayesian methods produces a distribution of effect sizes that would be compatible with observed trial data, interpreted in the context of prior assumptions about an intervention (called âpriorsâ). These priors are chosen by investigators to reflect existing beliefs and past empirical evidence regarding the effect of an intervention. By calculating the likelihood of clinical benefit, a Bayesian reanalysis can augment the interpretation of a trial. However, if priors are not defined a priori, there is a legitimate concern that priors could be constructed in a manner that produces biased results. Therefore, some standardization of priors for Bayesian reanalysis of clinical trials may be desirable for the critical care community. In this Critical Care Perspective, we discuss both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to clinical trial analysis, introduce a framework that researchers can use to select priors for a Bayesian reanalysis, and demonstrate how to apply our proposal by conducting a novel Bayesian trial reanalysis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite increased secondary cardiovascular events in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), the expression of innate cardiac protective molecules in the hearts of patients with ICM is incompletely characterized. Therefore, we used a nonbiased RNAseq approach to determine whether differences in cardiac protective molecules occur with ICM. METHODS AND RESULTS: RNAseq analysis of human control and ICM left ventricular samples demonstrated a significant decrease in KCNJ11 expression with ICM. KCNJ11 encodes the Kir6.2 subunit of the cardioprotective KATP channel. Using wild-type mice and kcnj11-deficient (kcnj11-null) mice, we examined the effect of kcnj11 expression on cardiac function during ischemia-reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen species generation increased in kcnj11-null hearts above that found in wild-type mice hearts after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Continuous left ventricular pressure measurement during ischemia and reperfusion demonstrated a more compromised diastolic function in kcnj11-null compared with wild-type mice during reperfusion. Analysis of key calcium-regulating proteins revealed significant differences in kcnj11-null mice. Despite impaired relaxation, kcnj11-null hearts increased phospholamban Ser16 phosphorylation, a modification that results in the dissociation of phospholamban from sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+, thereby increasing sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-mediated calcium reuptake. However, kcnj11-null mice also had increased 3-nitrotyrosine modification of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, a modification that irreversibly impairs sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ function, thereby contributing to diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: KCNJ11 expression is decreased in human ICM. Lack of kcnj11 expression increases peroxynitrite-mediated modification of the key calcium-handling protein sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, contributing to impaired diastolic function. These data suggest a mechanism for ischemia-induced diastolic dysfunction in patients with ICM.},

  abstract = {Bayesian adaptive designs have become popular because of the possibility of increasing the number of patients treated with more beneficial treatments, while still providing sufficient evidence for treatment efficacy comparisons. It can be essential, for regulatory and other purposes, to conduct frequentist analyses both before and after a Bayesian adaptive trial, and these remain challenging. In this paper, we propose a general simulation-based approach to compare frequentist designs with Bayesian adaptive designs based on frequentist criteria such as power and to compute valid frequentist p-values. We illustrate our approach by comparing the power of an equal randomization (ER) design with that of an optimal Bayesian adaptive (OBA) design. The Bayesian design considered here is the dynamic programming solution of the optimization of a specific utility function defined by the number of successes in a patient horizon, including patients whose treatment will be affected by the trial's results after the end of the trial. While the power of an ER design depends on treatment efficacy and the sample size, the power of the OBA design also depends on the patient horizon size. Our results quantify the trade-off between power and the optimal assignment of patients to treatments within the trial. We show that, for large patient horizons, the two criteria are in agreement, while for small horizons, differences can be substantial. This has implications for precision medicine, where patient horizons are decreasing as a result of increasing stratification of patients into subpopulations defined by molecular markers.},

  abstract = {The statistical practice of modeling interaction with two linear main effects and a product term is ubiquitous in the statistical and epidemiological literature. Most data modelers are aware that the misspecification of main effects can potentially cause severe type I error inflation in tests for interactions, leading to spurious detection of interactions. However, modeling practice has not changed. In this article, we focus on the specific situation where the main effects in the model are misspecified as linear terms and characterize its impact on common tests for statistical interaction. We then propose some simple alternatives that fix the issue of potential type I error inflation in testing interaction due to main effect misspecification. We show that when using the sandwich variance estimator for a linear regression model with a quantitative outcome and two independent factors, both the Wald and score tests asymptotically maintain the correct type I error rate. However, if the independence assumption does not hold or the outcome is binary, using the sandwich estimator does not fix the problem. We further demonstrate that flexibly modeling the main effect under a generalized additive model can largely reduce or often remove bias in the estimates and maintain the correct type I error rate for both quantitative and binary outcomes regardless of the independence assumption. We show, under the independence assumption and for a continuous outcome, overfitting and flexibly modeling the main effects does not lead to power loss asymptotically relative to a correctly specified main effect model. Our simulation study further demonstrates the empirical fact that using flexible models for the main effects does not result in a significant loss of power for testing interaction in general. Our results provide an improved understanding of the strengths and limitations for tests of interaction in the presence of main effect misspecification. Using data from a large biobank study âThe Michigan Genomics Initiativeâ, we present two examples of interaction analysis in support of our results.},

A canonical example is the estimation of a vector of normal means. Frequently, structural information about relationships between the parameters of interest is available. For example, in a gene expression denoising problem, genes with similar functions may have similar expression levels. Despite its importance, structural information has not been well-studied in the simultaneous estimation literature, perhaps in part because it poses challenges to the usual geometric or empirical Bayes shrinkage estimation paradigms. This article proposes that some of these challenges can be resolved by adopting an alternate paradigm, based on regression modeling. This approach can naturally incorporate structural information and also motivates new shrinkage estimation and inference procedures. As an illustration, this regression paradigm is used to develop a class of estimators with asymptotic risk optimality properties that perform well in simulations and in denoising gene expression data from a single cell RNA-sequencing experiment.},

However, it may be difficult to interpret for patients and practitioners, especially when the hazard ratio is not constant over time. Alternative measures of the treatment effects have been proposed such as the difference of the restricted mean survival times, the difference in survival proportions at some fixed follow-up time, or the net chance of a longer survival. In this paper, we propose the restricted survival benefit (RSB), a quantity that can incorporate multiple useful measurements of treatment effects. Hence, it provides a framework for a comprehensive assessment of the treatment effects. We provide estimation and inference procedures for the RSB that accommodate censored survival outcomes, using methods of the inverse-probability-censoring-weighted -statistic and the jackknife empirical likelihood. We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the numerical performance of the proposed method, and we analyze data from a randomized Phase III clinical trial (SWOG S0777) using the proposed method.},

The frequentist inference procedure for RMST has been widely advocated for comparison of two survival curves, while research from the Bayesian perspective is rather limited. For the RMST of both right- and interval-censored data, we propose Bayesian nonparametric estimation and inference procedures. By assigning a mixture of Dirichlet processes (MDP) prior to the distribution function, we can estimate the posterior distribution of RMST. We also explore another Bayesian nonparametric approach using the Dirichlet process mixture model and make comparisons with the frequentist nonparametric method. Simulation studies demonstrate that the Bayesian nonparametric RMST under diffuse MDP priors leads to robust estimation and under informative priors it can incorporate prior knowledge into the nonparametric estimator. Analysis of real trial examples demonstrates the flexibility and interpretability of the Bayesian nonparametric RMST for both right- and interval-censored data.

  abstract = {Varying-coefficient models have become a common tool to determine whether and how the association between an exposure and an outcome changes over a continuous measure. These models are complicated when the exposure itself is time-varying and subjected to measurement error. For example, it is well known that longitudinal physical fitness has an impact on cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. It is not known, however, how the effect of longitudinal physical fitness on CVD mortality varies with age. In this paper, we propose a varying-coefficient generalized odds rate model that allows flexible estimation of age-modified effects of longitudinal physical fitness on CVD mortality. In our model, the longitudinal physical fitness is measured with error and modeled using a mixed-effects model, and its associated age-varying coefficient function is represented by cubic B-splines. An expectation-maximization algorithm is developed to estimate the parameters in the joint models of longitudinal physical fitness and CVD mortality. A modified pseudoadaptive Gaussian-Hermite quadrature method is adopted to compute the integrals with respect to random effects involved in the E-step. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through extensive simulation studies and is further illustrated with an application to cohort data from the Aerobic Center Longitudinal Study.},

This model includes many published landmark prediction models as special cases. We propose a unified local linear estimation framework to estimate time varying model parameters.

  abstract = {Although propensity scores have been central to the estimation of causal effects for over 30 years, only recently has the statistical literature begun to consider in detail methods for Bayesian estimation of propensity scores and causal effects. Underlying this recent body of literature on Bayesian propensity score estimation is an implicit discordance between the goal of the propensity score and the use of Bayesâ theorem. The propensity score condenses multivariate covariate information into a scalar to allow estimation of causal effects without specifying a model for how each covariate relates to the outcome. Avoiding specification of a detailed model for the outcome response surface is valuable for robust estimation of causal effects, but this strategy is at odds with the use of Bayesâ theorem, which presupposes a full probability model for the observed data that adheres to the likelihood principle. The goal of this article is to explicate this fundamental feature of Bayesian estimation of causal effects with propensity scores to provide context for the existing literature and for future work on this important topic.[Received June 2014. Revised September 2015.]},

  abstract = {Rank-based methods are frequently used in the life sciences, and in the empirical sciences in general. Among the best-known examples of nonparametric rank-based tests are the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and the KruskalâWallis test. However, recently, potential pitfalls and paradoxical results pertaining to the use of traditional rank-based procedures for more than two samples have been highlighted, and the so-called pseudo-ranks have been proposed as a remedy for this type of problems. The aim of the present article is twofold: First, we show that pseudo-ranks might also behave counterintuitively when splitting up groups. Second, since the use of pseudo-ranks leads to a slightly different interpretation of the results, we provide some guidance regarding the decision for one or the other approach, in particular with respect to interpretability and generalizability of the findings. It turns out that the choice of the reference distribution, to which the individual groups are compared, is crucial. The practically relevant implications of these aspects are illustrated by a discussion of a dataset from epilepsy research. Summing up, one should decide based on thorough case-by-case considerations whether ranks or pseudo-ranks are appropriate.},

Despite improvements in methodology and design of clinical trials, and advances in understanding the underlying pathophysiology of rodent AKI, no pharmacologic agent exists for the prevention or treatment of AKI in humans. To address the barriers that affect successful clinical translation of drug targets identified and validated in preclinical animal models of AKI in this patient population, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases convened the "AKI Outcomes: Overcoming Barriers in AKI" workshop on February 10-12, 2015. The workshop used a reverse translational medicine approach to identify steps necessary to achieve clinical success. During the workshop, breakout groups were charged first to design feasible, phase 2, proof-of-concept clinical trials for delayed transplant graft function, prevention of AKI (primary prevention), and treatment of AKI (secondary prevention and recovery). Breakout groups then were responsible for identification of preclinical animal models that would replicate the pathophysiology of the phase 2 proof-of-concept patient population, including primary and secondary end points. Breakout groups identified considerable gaps in knowledge regarding human AKI, our understanding of the pathophysiology of AKI in preclinical animal models, and the fidelity of cellular and molecular targets that have been evaluated preclinically to provide information regarding human AKI of various etiologies. The workshop concluded with attendees defining a new path forward to a better understanding of the etiology, pathology, and pathophysiology of human AKI.},

  abstract = {Many statistical methods have been proposed for variable selection in the past century, but few balance inference and prediction tasks well. Here, we report on a novel variable selection approach called penalized regression with second-generation p-values (ProSGPV). It captures the true model at the best rate achieved by current standards, is easy to implement in practice, and often yields the smallest parameter estimation error. The idea is to use an l0 penalization scheme with second-generation p-values (SGPV), instead of traditional ones, to determine which variables remain in a model. The approach yields tangible advantages for balancing support recovery, parameter estimation, and prediction tasks. The ProSGPV algorithm can maintain its good performance even when there is strong collinearity among features or when a high-dimensional feature space with p {$>$} n is considered. We present extensive simulations and a real-world application comparing the ProSGPV approach with smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), adaptive lasso (AL), and minimax concave penalty with penalized linear unbiased selection (MC+). While the last three algorithms are among the current standards for variable selection, ProSGPV has superior inference performance and comparable prediction performance in certain scenarios.},
