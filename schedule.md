Notes](http://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf) | [New html Course Notes](http://hbiostat.org/bbr/md)
## Course Schedule

Sessions are held 10:00-11:00am US Eastern Time on most Fridays.  Links labeled "Offline discussion" for each section's outline below will take you to a dedicated
[datamethods.org](http://datamethods.org) topic for in-depth or post-live
session discussions.  You can go directlly to the discussion topic for session n by going to `bit.ly/datamethods-bbrn` e.g. `...-bbr1`.  Short questions and comments made during the live broadcast should be entered in YouTube's live chat.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o_ZZ0tuFUYn8e8rf-QURA) is the link to the YouTube channel, and after each video premieres you can go directly to the video for session by going to `bit.ly/yt-bbrn`.

**NOTE**: Beginning with Session 15 on 2020-04-03 and lasting at least until the coronavirus crisis subsides, the course is shifting to a "study at your own pace" mode with the scheduled 10am-11am EDT time slot set aside for questions, answers, and discussions.  Discussions will take place on the `datamethods.org` topic listed for each session, supplemented by live video/audio/text chat on [Zoom](https://vanderbilt.zoom.us/j/958795263).  This mode uses the new HTML version of the course notes at [hbiostat.org/bbr/md](http://hbiostat.org/bbr/md) which will automatically size to any viewing device.  When studying the notes before the online meeting, listen to audio narration and watch videos that are linked from the notes in the right margin.  For any questions or discussion on `datamethods` add any mnemonic shown in blue boxes in the right margin of course notes (e.g. `reg:ancova`) somewhere in the `datamethods` topic so that the course notes will automatically link to that discussion.  Contact Frank Harrell if you would like to have a new mnemonic added to the course notes for linking with a discussion you add in `datamethods`.
