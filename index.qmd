# Preface {.unnumbered}

The book is aimed at exposing biomedical researchers to modern biostatistical methods and statistical graphics, highlighting those methods that make fewer assumptions, including nonparametric statistics and robust statistical measures. In addition to covering traditional estimation and inferential techniques, the course contrasts those with the Bayesian approach, and also includes several components that have been increasingly important in the past few years, such as challenges of high-dimensional data analysis, modeling for observational treatment comparisons, analysis of differential treatment effect (heterogeneity of treatment effect), statistical methods for biomarker research, medical diagnostic research, and methods for reproducible research.  A glossary of statistical terms for non-statisticians is [here](http://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf).[[BBR course](https://hbiostat.org/bbrc)]{.aside} [`R Workflow`](https://hbiostat.org/rflow) is a useful companion to this book, especially for those needing to manipulate data in preparation for analysis and for those interested in embedding statistical analyses in state-of-the-art reproducible reports.

### Symbols Used in the Right Margin of the Text

* Blue symbols in the right margin starting with ABD designate section
numbers (and occasionally page numbers preceeded by $p$) in _The
Analysis of Biological Data, Second Edition_ by MC Whitlock and D
Schluter, Greenwood Village CO, Roberts and Company, 2015.
* Right blue symbols starting with RMS designate section numbers in _Regression
Modeling Strategies, 2nd ed._ by FE Harrell, Springer, 2015.
* <img src="movie.png" width="15px"> in the right margin is a
  hyperlink to a YouTube video related to the subject.
* <img src="discourse.png" width="15px"> is a hyperlink to the
  discussion topic in `datamethods.org` devoted to the specific
  `YouTube` video session.  You can go directly to the discussion
  about session `n` by going to `bit.ly/datamethods-bbrn`.  Some of
  the sessions on `YouTube` also had live chat which you can select to
  replay while watching the video.
* Boxed <span style="color:blue;">blue text</span> in the right margin represents a mnemonic key for linking to discussions about that section in
  [datamethods](http://datamethods.org).  Anyone starting a new
  discussion about a topic related to the section should include the
  mnemonic somewhere in the posting.  When you click on the blue boxed
  text the `datamethods` search result of all topics containing that mnemonic will appear, and the user can navigate from it to the topic of interest to read or add content.
* An audio player symbol indicates that narration elaborating on the
  notes is available for the section.  Red letters and
numbers in the right margin are cues referred to within the audio
recordings.
* <span style="color:blue;">blog</span> in the right margin is a link to a blog entry
that further discusses the topic.

## Acknowledgement

This material grew largely out of teaching clinical scholars and in Master of Science in Clinical Investigation programs at Duke University, University of Virginia, and Vanderbilt University. I benefitted immensely from lecture notes from colleagues such as Kerry Lee of Duke University.  Thanks also goes to Vanderbilt Biostatistics colleague James C. Slaughter who made several contributions to an earlier version of the book at [hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf](https://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf).
